If user add the Effective Rate to the relevant field and press enter should calculate the flat interest rate for the added EIR and should display at the Flat Interest Rate field.

The effective interest rate (EIR), also known as the effective annual interest rate (EAR) or the annual equivalent rate (AER), is a standardized way of expressing the interest rate on a loan or financial product over a specific time period, typically one year.

Here's how you can use this formula:

·         Convert the effective interest rate to a decimal by dividing it by 100 if it's given as a percentage.

·         Determine the number of compounding periods per year.

·         Plug the values into the formula and calculate the result.

For example, let's say you have an effective interest rate of 6% per year and interest is compounded quarterly n = 4: Now, calculate the result to find the equivalent flat interest rate.

This formula allows you to find the flat interest rate that is equivalent to a given effective interest rate over a specific compounding period.

Type the user reference number assigned to identify the transaction.

Type the narration of the transaction. The system displays the default narration ""Non Cash Deposit"". User can change the narration, if required.

LVCR flag should be updated as “YES” if the deposit amount is greater than the LVCR threshold limit. This LVCR threshold limit will be defined in the LVCR threshold limit definition in the AML module. this is need to be validated only if the AML threshold limit feature has been enabled in the CASA master module control level. Please refer the feature code “AMLT - AML Threshold Limits”.

If the deposit amount is exceed the defined LVCR threshold limit then it is mandatory enter the source fund details for the deposit transaction. this is a alphanumeric field.

Need to check whether there are un - recovered charges for the account once the cash deposit is completed & balance has been updated.

If there are multiple unrecovered charges then Priority should be based on the charge date in the charge log

If the charge recovery method has been selected as “Fully” for selected unrecovered charge type then need to check whether the deposited amount (Actual Balance after the transfer in transaction) is sufficient to recover the full charge amount. if the account balance is sufficient then need to deduct the charge amount from the account immediately and need to update the account balance immediately. at the same time need to update the balance fee amount to zero once the recovery transaction has been completed. if there are multiple charges then need to recover all of them one by one until the balance is sufficient to recover the charge amount. (Priority should be based on the charge date in the charge log). if the account balance is not sufficient to recover the full charge amount then need to move to next charge type immediately.

If the recovery method has been defined as the “Partial” then need to recover the recoverable amount from the account balance and need to update the transaction details for the charge / fee with the recovered amount. need to update the remaining charge / Fee amount in the balance fee amount column in the unrecoverable charges log.

Once the charge / Fee amount has been recovered as the full charge amount or partial charge amount then those charge details should be updated in transaction details with below details for each & every charge recovered.

if there is a minus balance in the deposit account then need to check whether there are balances to be allocated in balance allocation table. if there are any balances to be settled in allocation table then need to allocate the deposit amount to the available balances according to the allocation order defined for the each transaction subtype under the current account status based on the transaction date. this allocation order is already defined in the allocation order definition level. Need to block the transaction processing if the allocation order has not been defined for the transaction types in allocation table.",40
