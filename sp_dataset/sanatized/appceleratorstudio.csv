TISTUD-215,App Explorer view should transition to the Debug perspective,"when the user opens a debugging session, and switches to the debug perspective, only the eclipse debug button is left for re launching the application while still in the debug perspective. this makes the user experience somewhat inconsistent because (presumably) they will be launching from the debug button inside the app explorer (""titanium"" perspective). if we have the app explorer itself exist in both perspectives, it should give the same interface for launching to the user.",1,train

TISTUD-273,Allow selection by CamelCase,"in another ican'tnameit eclipse based ide, there's a feature where you can select things based on camelcase, instead of by word, which is very handy.    example: if i have code like this:    /pintley/ui/components/morerow.js    on os x, if i put my cursor between ""row"" and "".js"", hold down optionshift, and hit the left arrow, it would highlight ""row"" instead of ""morerow"". it's a huge timesaver, but i can see that not everyone would like it. i just want the option.",8,train

could see the apps behind it slightly but not access them.    this is what i might call a slightly nicer display of a os crash than a full bsod (blue screen of death) on a windows machine. when i

TISTUD-2311,Studio: Build for device and packaging show a list of simulators instead of SDK.,"while investigating issues discovered with xcode 4.5, it became clear that what we were seeing as a bug where the sdk scripts were ignoring what was set as ios sdk during studio build for device or packaging was actually studio displaying a list of simulator versions.    this option should show either the actual list of sdk versions. the result of setting something other than an available sdk is that the setting is ignored. since this is a list of emulators, this happens nearly every build (unless you choose a version where you have both simulator and sdk).    this is not a regression, it occurs in many previous versions.     steps to reproduce:  1) ensure xcodeselect path and studio preference are in sync. (refresh and restart studio if required)  2) run terminal command ""xcodebuild showsdks"" for later comparison  3) create a new project in studio and attempt to build for device.  4) note pulldown options    result:  pulldown contains a list of simulators. check the xcodebuild results which should be something like:    os x sdks:   mac os x 10.7                  sdk macosx10.7   os x 10.8                      sdk macosx10.8    ios sdks:   ios 6.0                        sdk iphoneos6.0    ios simulator sdks:   simulator  ios 5.0            sdk iphonesimulator5.0   simulator  ios 5.1            sdk iphonesimulator5.1   simulator  ios 6.0             sdk iphonesimulator6.0        expected:  a list of sdks.",5,train

TISTUD-5295,Add diagnostic tests for troubleshooting npm configuration issues,"if any user has npm installation issues either with or without prefix configured, then it might not be very easy to judge the problem on the user's machine, especially with npm prefix configuration.    instead of asking user each time to run a series of commands on their machine to figure out the underlying problem, we can add those commands in the diagnostic tests and that should let us give a fair idea on what is going on user's machine with just the diagnostic test logs.    when the npm updates are invoked, either during startup or by the user     1) it verifies whether the package is installed on the machine using 'npm g ls /' command.  1.1) if the above command fails for any reason, then invokes 'npm p ls g'  2) if the package is available on the machine, it figures out the installed version and latest available version using 'npm view / version' command.    also, since prefix is one of those dark areas, we need to add the prefix configuration to the diagnostic logs.    1) environment variable : get the system property for npmconfigprefix  2) get the prefix key from the npm configuration : npm config get prefix  3) if only the environment variable is set, then the local prefix config value differs from the global one. that can lead to discrepancies in the installation of npm packages. so we should get the output for : 'sudo npm config get prefix'. however, since we don't hold user's password, this might not be a feasible value to store in the diagnostic tests.",5,val

TISTUD-6541,Studio Formatter behaves incorrectly causing JSHint errors,"i have noticed that the formatter used within the studio application has a number of issues that are causing me and my team a lot of difficulties when working with different tools and attempting to maintain a high level of code quality.    1. studio reformats functions and var declarations within functions incorrectly. i say incorrect as it can cause jshint errors afterwards also existing formatting applied, say by developer a, gets reformatted by studio when developer b edits the documents.    here is an example of a small function example that has been formatted with sublime text 2 and passes jshint. it is also the style that i wish to use, which also is recommended in many books regarding code quality with javascript.      /    test file for appcelerator studio formatting bug       @author ketan majmudar   /    /    example function that maintains a space after the function parantheses and the braces.    variable declaration within is indented for readibility and also allows for git merges    to be easily reviewed. the       ""use strict""; is used internally and is another issue when the studio foramtter is used,     it throws errors when using jslint and should respect certain code style guide conventions.      /    function examplefunction()       ti.api.log(myvar1  myvar2  myvar3);  }    exports.examplefunction = examplefunction;      the case should be indented with the switch, the vars should stay on a newline and the ""use strict""; should not move.    this raises a wider question as why we can't use jsbeautifer rules/tags for certain settings. the formatting options and rules probably would better serve us if they adopted more of this standard approach that is more widely adopted. (just an idea).    my main issue is this current reformatting.    key issues that need to be addressed:   ""use strict""; should not reflow immediately after the brace   var declarations on newlines should not all be placed on a single line    switch statements should not indent cases.",9,val

(plus one is more global  the win 8 publisher guid, while the other is appspecific  the windows phone product id).    the important change is likely to make the pref page handle showing/editing the new windows publisher id config value now (in place of the windows phone publisher guid we discussed above that it currently surfaces). it's defined for the cli here: https:/github.com/sgtcoolguy/titaniummobilewindows/blob/master/cli/commands/build/config/winpublisherid.js  it's stored in the ti cli config key windows.publisherid, and can be specified on the comm,and line with the winpublisherid or i switch. the value is assigned by ms when you sign up for a dev center account, and would be found on your windows dev ceter dashboard at https:/dev.windows.com/en us/account/management      ",3,test

TISTUD-7981,Use appc daemon to request system info,"appcelerator studio will no longer need to call ti info t / a bunch of times each minute. with the appc daemon, studio can simply connect to the server over a websocket and query the system information as well as listen for changes.    the appc daemon will ship with the appc cli, so studio will not need to worry about installing the appc daemon. however, studio will need to make sure appcd is running before trying to connect to it. if appcd is already running, the start operation immediately returns successfully.    note: appcd isn't guaranteed to be globally installed. you will want to manually invoke it by calling node /path/to/appcd start.    this applies to all platforms: os x, linux, and windows.    studio will need to open a websocket to 127.0.0.1 port 1732. once the socket is open, it will need to send a request using the appcd protocol. it's pretty simple. to kick off a request, studio needs to send a stringified json object containing a version, path, id, and optionally a data payload.    here's the javascript equivalent:      socket.send(json.stringify();      the ""version"" must be 1.0.    the ""path"" can be /systeminfo to get the info for all supported platforms (i.e. android & ios on osx, android & windows on windows, android on linux). the ""path"" may also contain the specific platform such as /systeminfo/ios or even platform specific info such as /system info/ios/devices.    the ""id"" must be a string containing a unique request id. it can be a sequential number (cast as a string) or a uuid. the purpose of the ""id"" is that a single websocket can service multiple simultaneous requests and ""id"" is the only way you can match up the response with the initial request. for example, the appcd client generates a uuid for each request and then registers that uuid with an event emitter so that responses to the request id are emitted to the code that made the request. studio can use whatever mechanism it wishes to match responses with requests.    the ""data"" payload is optional. it's a json object containing additional information. it will allow studio to specify additional request arguments and filtering options.    the response is a stringified json object containing an id, data, and possibly a status.    if the latest appc cli is not installed, and thus appc daemon is not installed, then studio should continue to use the ti info method it does today.",8,test

TISTUD-8011,Studio should rely on CLI to find updates ,"with 5.1.2.ga, 5.2.0.rc and 6.0.0 nightly installed, studio update says latest titanium sdk already installed and does not install 5.2.0.ga. renaming the 6.0.0 folder to 6.0.0.ci or the original 6.0.0.v20160110233608 does not fix it. removing the folder does.    i traced it back here, but can't really tell why it thinks 5.2.0.ga is already installed:  https:/github.com/appcelerator/titaniumstudio/blob/bcb31abca5a44bddc7a962319d5b040b4d3610c0/plugins/com.appcelerator.titanium.update.core/src/com/appcelerator/titanium/update/internal/core/titaniumreleasesupdater.java#l841l842    looking at the code for https:/github.com/appcelerator/titaniumstudio/blob/bcb31abca5a44bddc7a962319d5b040b4d3610c0/plugins/com.appcelerator.titanium.update.core/src/com/appcelerator/titanium/update/internal/core/titaniumreleasesupdater.java#l579 and https:/github.com/appcelerator/titaniumstudio/blob/938ba3b47c1ab33add316308e6593ee99cd329b6/plugins/com.appcelerator.titanium.core/src/com/appcelerator/titanium/core/mobile/sdkreleasegafilter.java it should find 5.1.2.ga as my latest sdk.    so then something must be wrong with https:/github.com/appcelerator/titaniumstudio/blob/bcb31abca5a44bddc7a962319d5b040b4d3610c0/plugins/com.appcelerator.titanium.update.core/src/com/appcelerator/titanium/update/internal/core/titaniumreleasesupdater.java#l830 which uses https:/github.com/appcelerator/titaniumstudio/blob/938ba3b47c1ab33add316308e6593ee99cd329b6/plugins/com.appcelerator.titanium.core/src/com/appcelerator/titanium/core/descendingstreamawareversioncomparator.java    wherever the bug exactly is i think we can simplify and make this a lot more stable:     don't duplicate this logic (including it's bugs: cli705) in cli and studio, but let studio rely on cli to find updates so we have only one point of failure.   don't rely on the sdk release version name (for available releases) and folder name (for installed releases) to determine what is available and installed, but use the checksum or timestamp (timob19541, see appc ti sdk list) so the logic does not fail if people rename sdk folders (cli910).    don't compare if the latest available release is newer then the latest one installed, but simply check if the latest available release is installed. this removes all the points of failure in stuff like https:/github.com/appcelerator/titaniumstudio/blob/938ba3b47c1ab33add316308e6593ee99cd329b6/plugins/com.appcelerator.titanium.core/src/com/appcelerator/titanium/core/descendingstreamawareversioncomparator.java    logs to help debug the current issue:        !entry com.appcelerator.titanium.update.core 1 0 20160223 09:01:13.106  !message (build 4.5.0.201602170821) [info] com.appcelerator.titanium.update.core/debug/sdkupdate retrieving the list of titanium mobilesdk from url: https:/f4df0833a1352ef193633d85356e6e80ffcdcdb7.cloudappenterprise.appcelerator.com/api/mobilesdk/releases/2599177901c441a6a4d386107428797b    !entry com.appcelerator.titanium.update.core 1 0 20160223 09:01:16.610  !message (build 4.5.0.201602170821) [info] com.appcelerator.titanium.update.core/debug/sdkupdate available titanium mobilesdk: ,         ,         ,         ,          ,         ,         ,         ,           ,          ,          ,          ,           ,          ,          ,          ,            ,          ,          ,          ,           ,          ,          ,          ,            ,          ,          ,          ,           ,          ,          ,          ,            ,          ,          ,          ,            ,          ,          ,          {              ""buildtype"": ""10.5i386"",              ""name"": ""mobilesdk"",              ""guid"": ""c5a13520e0914ceabfc3 ae453d23238d"",              ""versio...",5,test
