APSTUD-4285,Research heap exception and excessive I/O during indexing JS,"some profiling has been done already which has identified that:    # a large number of strings/char[] are being held onto during indexing. i think it's safe to assume that's related to js inferencing, but that will need to be confirmed. once that is verified, we need to look into why that is happening.  # there are a huge number of disk writes occurring during js inferencing. i confirmed this by re indexing the referenced project with js indexing on and off. we know the issue is coming from js inferencing due to the fact that index is not designed to support reads when doing lots of writes. we will need to determine how we can avoid or how we can minimize reading from the index during inferencing.",20,train
APSTUD-4289,JS indexing stores duplicate user agents on properties and functions,"while gathering stats on how js indexing info is stored, i noticed that some properties and functions were quite large in the index (>4k). looking at a few of these, i see that there is a large amount of user agent added to some of the entries and many of these are duplicates. so, we will need to switch over to using a set to contain user agent elements and user agent elements themselves will need equals and hashcode implementations",8,train
APSTUD-4292,Consider caching UserAgentElements used in JS indexing,"during profiling of indexing for a large js project, i noticed that we had a large number of allocations of useragentelements. there is a finite list of these, so we should be able to cache these instances, thus avoiding a large number of allocations and garbage collection steps.",8,train
APSTUD-4298,Consider using a special token to indicate that a given JS type or member should have all user agents associated with it,"given the number of user agents we attach with inferred types and members, we should use a custom tag to indicate that the item should have all user agents associated with it. looking at a large method entry in the index, we could cut down one entry from 3359 to 2595, for example. this may not sound significant, but in the closure library this could potentially shave off as much as 42mb from a 71mb index given the high number of property and function counts there. this, of course, would need to be verified and should be considered an upper maximum in file size reduction",8,train
APSTUD-4300,Consider improving the performance of StringUtil.join,"during profiling i noticed a large number of calls to stringutil.join. at times, this method appeared as a hot spot as well. i believe the current implementation can be improved by pre allocating a char[] of the destination size followed by copying of the strings and delimiters into this array. this is similar to what stringbuilder is doing; however, we avoid a number of method calls and we have the advantage of knowing the resulting size a priori. note that stringbuilder does allow the initial capacity to be defined. fwiw, i had made similar changes in parsenode for the child arrays (replaced arraylist with our own inline implementation) and this affected performance dramatically.",8,train
APSTUD-4301,Reduce number of refreshes in Git Index and reduce work done during refresh,"previously i thought we could entirely remove refreshes when files change inside a git connected project. turns out that we couldn't but there are other things we can do:   when we get resource change events, only update the changed files, don't do a full batch refresh.   don't call batch refreshes from some actions like deleting files/folder or moving files through our ui. the connected filewatcher on the repo should pick up a file event or two to the ""index"" file which will trigger a batch refresh.    when we do refresh we call one process and then we spawn off 3 parallel jobs to each run another process to update our listings. we may be able to reduce the number of processes down to as low as one in most cases (or two in worst case).",8,train

APSTUD-4406,"Character Encoding options broken, falsely reporting UTF-8","a well known issue with deploying titanium projects to android that has existed for a long, long time is problems with the android emulator requiring files to be utf8.    so naturally if you ran across the issue when using tistudio, you would right click the files, go to properties and check your 'text file encoding' was set to utf08. it automatically chooses the option titled 'inherited from container (utf8)'.    so according to aptana/tistudio, the file is set to utf8. yet the android emulator is still throwing a wobbly over a non utf8 file.    i then opened the exact file in coda (by panic.com) to find that every single one of the titanium studio files was in face set to ""western (mac os roman)"" and not utf8. i edited the files to utf8 via coda and hey presto, the android project works. the same action in aptana/tistudio does not work, it leaves the files in their old encoding.    the bug here is quite simply that the aptana text file encoding options for files dont change the file encoding at all. this has been present since at very least when appcelerator bought out titanium studio.    more info on this bug can be found here: http:/developer.appcelerator.com/question/88591/unicodedecodeerrorutf8codeccantdecodebyte0x80inposition#comment 114842",13,train

APSTUD-4445,"Content assist, inference, and documentation languages lack expressions to explicitly relate types to identifiers","the languages defined for adding documentation that affects content assist (scriptdoc, sdocml, jsca json) have type expressions whose grammer is inadequate in cases where the type is not specifically known beforehand, but can reliably be deduced from parameters.  consider the es5 object.create, which creates a new object with a prototype specified by its parameter:      foo = new knowtypewithdocumentedproperties;  bar = object.create(foo);      in that case, bar will have the same properties as foo.  however, it is not possible to infer them from the (hypothetical future) documentation for the object.create method because the documentation languages lack a way to express that the return type will be the same as one of the parameters.    perhaps more common:      baseclass.prototype.chainablemethod = function ()     derivedclass.prototype = new baseclass;    exampleinstance = new derivedclass;  examplereturn = exampleinstance.chainablemethod();      it is currently impossible to express that chainablemethod returns the same type as the object that owns it.  at best, inference will be able to guess that examplereturn is an instance of baseclass.  if many types derive from baseclass, this is a problem, since content assist will be unable to infer any of the subclass properties after the call to chainablemethod, and a chainable method's purpose is to conveniently call additional methods on the return value.    the following would be really maddening to document:      dojo.declare(""my.classname"", superclass, ,      someproperty: / ... /  });    instance = new my.classname;      all of the properties that should be inferred for instance are in the parameters to dojo.declare; some day, when the scriptdoc tags for assigning class membership work for inference, it will be possible for dojo users to document the class, but it will still be difficult/impossible for the authors of dojo.declare to provide type information.    rather than add special cases in the aptana source to deal with each of these specifically (and add more as they appear), it is preferable to extend the documentation languages' type expressions to include operators or new tags capable of explicitly stating a type's relationship to an identifier.      because inference from simple assignments is now working quite well, the simplest solution might be a 'typeof' operator in scriptdoc/sdocml/jsca type expressions whose operand is a javascript expression.  the same inference code that is now working would evaluate the provided expression in the context of the invocation where it's found to determine the return type.",13,train

APSTUD-4644,Convert CSS AST to a generalize tree structure,"our current css ast nodes do not make use of the parent child relationship as implied by the iparsenode interface. instead, collections of child nodes are placed into arrays/collections which hang off of node properties. this makes it difficult to apply a process to the tree as a whole. we will need to create a css node type that is used to as a collection of nodes. then we can rely on child position to retrieve the elements that are now being placed in fields. once this change is done, this will certainly impact code that relies on the current shape of the ast: formatting, folding, outline, etc.",13,train

APSTUD-4649,Consider allowing binary data in Indexes,"our current indexing implementation allows for string data only to be written to the index. in order to take advantage of some more compressed and more performant data formats, we would need to allow binary data to be written. note that supporting binary data directly would be a large change. alternately, we could convert the binary data to an ascii format, like base64, but in my opinion, the additional overhead of performing that conversion may defeat the benefit we would gain from using one of the binary formats directly. another alternate might be to use a system next to indexing. that could be a separate file (or files) that contain the binary data where the entries in the index simply point to those files.",13,train

APSTUD-4661,Refresh using Native Hooks or Polling Can't be Turned off (reappears after restart),"i've just upgraded to the latest aptana release (3.1.1.201204131931) and immediately hitting cpu usage issues with the cpu jumping to 90%ish every few seconds corresponding to a refresh of the workspace every few seconds. so i guess on my system aptana the option 'refresh using native hooks or polling' is polling rather than hooks as it happens regardless of whether or not i'm doing anything.    i've traced it down to the 'refresh using native hooks or polling' which is under the workspace menu. if i turn it off, the system quietens down and all is fine.     however, on a restart, this 'option' has reselected itself meaning (i guess) that the option is not reading it's setting correctly from the options saved (or perhaps isn't getting saved to the file?)    so the bug i'm reporting here is the preference can't be set beyond a restart and, of course, like all preferences it should be.    a second bug i guess is quite why the refresh of the workspace uses so much cpu  my system has 8000 files on a fairly old machine so i'm guessing it's hitting limits on my machine (results will of course vary on other machines). i've commented on that before (in the forums) and it was all fine in version 3 until now. i'll repeat my guess that there is a very inefficient method involved in the refresh of the workspace that still hasn't been resolved.     anyway  hopefully to replicate ...    type workspace in to the preferences and select workspaces at the bottom to get the ""refresh ... "" option. unselect it. restart the studio, go back to that preference and you'll (hopefully) see it selected again.    i've attached two images   the first when i deselected the option. the second when i restarted showing the option has been selected again.",8,train

APSTUD-4684,Limit number of columns colored to improve performance,i found that limiting the number of styleranges used makes a huge difference in performance for minified js files. a simple fix is to limit to not add any more ranges past the 200th column of any line in themingdamagerrepairer. there may be additional gains if we can reduce the number of ranges we generated (say skip ones that match the default fg/bg colors).,8,train

APSTUD-4840,Still Broken - Refresh using Native Hooks or Polling Can't be Turned off (reappears after reboot of machine),"this is a clone of bug apstud 4661 as i made the following comment on it, but i guess because that bug was deemed fixed, the comment went unnoticed. i've included the previous bug description after the new additional problem description.     the previous bug was not correctly fixed and the following describes the remaining, rather peculiar, issue.     i've upgraded to aptana studio 3, build: 3.1.2.201205041324 and have tested the following on mageia 1.x and ubuntu 12.04.    if i turn off the refresh checkbox, save and view it again it remains off. if i close down aptana and restart it, the checkbox remains off. if i close aptana, log out, log back in again, and restart aptana and view it, it remains off. the same is true if i don't close aptana before logging out.    however, if i reboot my machine, log in and then restart aptana, it is now back on again. in other words, the setting doesn't seem to survive a reboot.    i would guess this hints that the value is somehow being kept in memory and linux is reassigning that portion of memory to aptana during the restarts of aptana and even over a log out and log in again. don't know if that is possible, but i can't imagine why it's misbehaving only on a reboot otherwise.    steps to reproduce:  a) log in to either mageia 1.x, or ubuntu 12.04 or possibly other variants of linux or other oses(haven't tested on those)  b) start up aptana and turn off the refresh button  c) reboot your machine  d) log in again and start up aptana, and view the value. all things going well it's back on again.    who'd have thought one checkbox could be so mysterious!!      the original bug description was ...      i've just upgraded to the latest aptana release (3.1.1.201204131931) and immediately hitting cpu usage issues with the cpu jumping to 90%ish every few seconds corresponding to a refresh of the workspace every few seconds. so i guess on my system aptana the option 'refresh using native hooks or polling' is polling rather than hooks as it happens regardless of whether or not i'm doing anything.    i've traced it down to the 'refresh using native hooks or polling' which is under the workspace menu. if i turn it off, the system quietens down and all is fine.     however, on a restart, this 'option' has reselected itself meaning (i guess) that the option is not reading it's setting correctly from the options saved (or perhaps isn't getting saved to the file?)    so the bug i'm reporting here is the preference can't be set beyond a restart and, of course, like all preferences it should be.    a second bug i guess is quite why the refresh of the workspace uses so much cpu  my system has 8000 files on a fairly old machine so i'm guessing it's hitting limits on my machine (results will of course vary on other machines). i've commented on that before (in the forums) and it was all fine in version 3 until now. i'll repeat my guess that there is a very inefficient method involved in the refresh of the workspace that still hasn't been resolved.     anyway  hopefully to replicate ...    type workspace in to the preferences and select workspaces at the bottom to get the ""refresh ... "" option. unselect it. restart the studio, go back to that preference and you'll (hopefully) see it selected again.    i've attached two images   the first when i deselected the option. the second when i restarted showing the option has been selected again.",8,val

APSTUD-4883,Need ability to specify JSLint settings on a global level,"steps to reproduce  we just upgraded to studio 3.1.3, and now we get a ton of jslint errors in our code.

APSTUD-4895,"Highlighted text opaque, color schemes broken in PyDev","  my notebook computer, also running aptana 3, now has the same issue as my desktop.  i have now verified this issue on two different computers, both windows 7 x64.          i followed all of instructions in email, attached my theme, reset defaults on annotations and set defaults on theme and as you can see from the attached stillbuggy.png the issue remains.  in order to fix this i need to go to preferences > aptana studio > themes and press ""reset defaults"" without changing anything    every time i start i need to go do that reset defaults.  i don't think it's the theme: something buggy happens when aptana initializes that changes something in my settings.  having to go through settings to undo it is lame, and it has to be a change that happened with the latest upgrade.  please get someone to fix it... :)        after latest upgrade, highlighted text color (pydev editor) is opaque and changing theme colors does not work reliably.  all themes show behavior like the attached screenshot: the highlighted text foreground and background are the same color.  changing selected foreground colors does not work as expected: selecting a darkcolored selection background results in a lightcolored background.    selecting the theme override for pydevoccurrenceindication seems to fix the issue for the current session, but when i shut down aptana and restart the highlight is broken again, even though the little 'b' icon next to pydevoccurrenceindication is still selected.  i need to click it off and back on again to fix the highlight, which again only works until i restart.    i've been using aptana without issues for at least 6 months prior to this issue, and have not touched color settings in months.  the latest update seems to have broken theme handling.    mote updates: see screen2.png attached.  if you look closely, i selected a very dark gray(almost back) color for the line highlight and aptana is using a bright gray.  any color i choose for the line highlight is ignored, and aptana chooses a much brighter color.  aptana is just ignoring my setting for selected text altogether.      more updates: i have had two instances today where i started aptana, went in and changed pydevoccurrenceindication so that i could see highlighted text (the broken samebackgroundand foreground bug is 100% repeatable).  after switching to another window and switching back the highlight was broken again, requiring me to change the pydevoccurrenceindication setting again.      this is profoundly irritating.  i hope whatever change broke color handling was awesome enough to cause this much pain.",5,val

APSTUD-4897,The PHP parser should be improved to use the parse cache properly.,"in php a problem collector is notified about errors during the parse and when the parse finishes, errors are reported, instead of working by adding problems found and later reporting them (after a parse).    so, it does not work properly if it takes advantage of the parsing (because in this case, the actual parsing won't take place  and thus the error report won't happen).      error reporting happens in:   com.aptana.editor.php.internal.parser.phpparser.parse(iparsestate, workingparseresult)  at the statement: ast.flusherrors();      also, on revision afc72082e4ae14bedcc11a0c24053a45bdca5447, a cache with the 'last valid ast' was created inside the phpparser, but this seems odd, as the parser will always return the last 'good' parse, but this is not correct in the following situation:    1. create 2 files (both with unrelated content but with errors)  2. close them  3. open one and fix the error  4. open the other one (already with the error): the php ast returned will be wrong as the one with the 'last good parse' will be returned    this would also break the parsingengine cache if it was in place because the parser would have the wrong ast returned.",20,val

APSTUD-5030,Simple Inline Conditionals for PHP,"i posted this request a while ago on stackoverflow here: http:/stackoverflow.com/questions/9414781/aptanasimpleinlineconditionalsfor php   it was suggested to post for an improvement here.    i'd like to use aptana for its php formatting ability. however there is one improvement i'd like to see, which is an option to keep simple inline statements on one line.  the javascript editor does this for eclipse, so i'd hope it's not too hard to replicate for aptana (native).    the desired format is this:      if ($test == false) return false;    however, aptana php formatter formats the line like this:    if ($test == false)      return false;    this gets really annoying when you test anything more than 1 at a time:        if ($test1 == false) return false;      if ($test2 == 14) return false;     if ($test3 == """") return false;    becomes:      if ($test1 == false)           return false;      if ($test2 == 14)           return false;      if ($test3 == """")           return false;    sgibly responded with this:  there is no way to force it at the moment. the if body is wrapped as a block and forced to the second line.

APSTUD-5031,"Support equivalent of Brackets.io ""Quick edit""","from brackets' page:    quick edit  one of the goals of brackets is to make it easy to make quick edits to different bits of code without having to jump around between files.    currently, brackets has an early implementation of this. if you're in an html file, and you put the cursor inside a class or id attribute or a tag name, you can hit ctrl/cmde (for ""edit""). brackets will search the css files in the file tree for relevant rules, then open up an inline editor embedded in the html file that lets you make quick tweaks to one of the rules.    on the right side of the inline editor, brackets shows the list of all rules that might be relevant to the selected tag/class/id. you can switch between the rules by clicking on them in the list, or using altup/down arrow.    you can make changes in the inline editor and save them, then close the editor by hitting cmde again. edits you make in the inline editor will be properly applied in live development mode (see below).    some things to note about this feature:    brackets doesn't take the cascade, tag context, etc. into account.  brackets doesn't check to see which css files are linked into the current html fileit searches all files in the file tree.  eventually brackets could leverage inline editing for lots of other kinds of things in addition to showing relevant js code, you could imagine adding inline visual tools like gradient and shadow editors for the selected css rule.",13,val

APSTUD-7286,Implement LRUCache with virtual memory paging scheme in editor infrastructure,"initially the main issue found is that the caching does not really work well with our multiparsing strategy.    when a parse for a large document is done, say, an html with 30 css and 10 js partitions, each of those will end up requesting a new parse and as our parse cache is an lru of size = 3, the cache is never used in this situation.    on the good side, once we get caches in place properly, when parsing a large document, we may have lots of subpartitions already cached, which should make the parsing faster when reparsing the full html.    ideas on approaches:    1. a simple approach is simply making the cache larger (say 256), but maybe we should have 2 different caches, one for 'outer' calls and another for 'internal' calls inside the parsing structure, but memory may be a problem here.    2. or maybe a single cache where we have an lru with a 'desired' max size but items are only prunned if not accessed for some time (say 10 seconds).    3. having a softhashmap may be a reasonable replacement too.    4. making proper use of the lrucache implementation we have which implements a virtual memory paging scheme (each value may have an associated size and the lru has a size related to that   the parsed document length may be a good tradeof in speed/size of the final generated ast).    selected approach:    lrucache with virtual memory paging scheme + softhashmap for pruned entries (which may be restored if still alive).",13,test

APSTUD-7477,Adjust JS index keys to be inline with expected usage,"when we decided to make use of the same index format as jdt, we expected to also retain similar usage. js usage of the index falls pretty far outside of that by effectively serializing properties/functions/events/event properties using json. this can lead to very large ""keys"" and can make it nearly impossible to do easy queries using patterns for particular attributes.    currently we store type, function, property, event, require. the first four are simply the declarations. the last is a very specific instance of recording references to the 'require' function/method.    jdt typically stores declarations with more details, but also stores references to types/fields/methods; and records references to supertypes/interfaces separate from the type declaration. additionally, declaration keys are typically simple and compact.    jdt:    type decl: typename / packagename / enclosingtypename / modifiers (modifiers are packed as an int, using 2 chars  and represent combo of class/interface/enum/annotation flag/markers)  super ref: supersimplename / superqualification / simplename / enclosingtypename / typeparameters / pkgname / superclassorinterface classorinterface modifiers  field ref and decl: fieldname  method: name / arity (arity is the arg/parameter count)      studio:    property: name, description, since, useragents, owning type, isclass, isinstance, isinternal, deprecated, types, examples  function: all from property plus isconstructor, ismethod, parameters, returntypes, exceptions, references.    parameters (included in function): name, types, usage, description    returntypes/types: type, description    exception: type, description  event: name, description, since, useragents, owning type, properties, deprecated    event property: name, description, since, useragents, type, deprecated      obviously we store much more information and we expect to fully serialize the metadata from the index, whereas jdt uses the index for matching and then opens the defining document/file and parses to reconstruct when more details are necessary. additionally we store type inferencing data in the index where jdt doesn't need to (it records type info in relavent index categories, but doesn't need to for fields/vars/methods as it can always easily look it up).    the open question is whether we can do the same  and to do so what sort of information will we need to record in the index and what can we lookup on demand?
