BAM-65,Allows CVS repo to timeout and report on locking issues,"sometimes, when you perform a cvs action you get something like      cvs update: [01:38:32] waiting for mchai's lock in /cvsroot/atlassian/maven2test/bamboo      so bamboo would probably just hang and become not so happy. we should allow bamboo to timeout, or conditionally stop and tell the user how to dix the problem",3,train

(with the same credentials even) worked fine.    there were two problems:   bamboo did bump up build number and this build failed, but nowhere it was really shown. i.e. on dashboard (and via remote api) i still got last build as successful. and although my build number (in above logs) was now greater than 1000, bamboo claimed on dashboard and via api that the last build is e.g. 500 (which happened to be the last one before these problems started)   cleaning working dir or full checkout did not help    i solved this problem by full clean and using anonymous svn access or my private account. only then bamboo finally showed new build on dashboard (with number > 1000) and its real status.    i suspect the problem may be also somehow connected to our svn server which could have applied some security policies to avoid dos attacks from bamboo (bamboo every 3 minutes   above 500 hundred times) was trying to checkout from svn the sources without success.

BAM-5182,Agent upload of artifacts fails to set Content-Length in HTTP/1.1 (on lighthttpd or nginx)," bamboo agent upload of artifacts fails to set contentlength:, causes problems when using a proxy that implements strict http/1.1    our preferred reverse proxy solution is lighttpd. however, use of lighttpd resulted in failure of bamboo agents to upload artifacts to the bamboo server.    upon investigation, we discovered the following error in the lighttpd error logs:    20100108 13:50:26: (request.c.1115) postrequest, but contentlength missing > 411     http/1.1  http:/  section 4.4:        ...      for compatibility with http/1.0 applications, http/1.1 requests      containing a messagebody must include a valid contentlength header      field unless the server is known to be http/1.1 compliant. if a      request contains a messagebody and a contentlength is not given,      the server should respond with 400 (bad request) if it cannot      determine the length of the message, or with 411 (length required) if      it wishes to insist on receiving a valid contentlength.    and below in section 10.4.12:        10.4.12 411 length required        the server refuses to accept the request without a defined content      length. the client may repeat the request if it adds a valid      contentlength header field containing the length of the messagebody      in the request message.    and further below in section :        14.13 contentlength        the contentlength entityheader field indicates the size of the      entitybody, in decimal number of octets, sent to the recipient or,      in the case of the head method, the size of the entitybody that      would have been sent had the request been a get.        contentlength = ""contentlength"" "":"" 1 digit        an example is        contentlength: 3495        applications should use this field to indicate the transferlength of      the messagebody, unless this is prohibited by the rules in section      4.4.        any contentlength greater than or equal to zero is a valid value.      section 4.4 describes how to determine the length of a messagebody      if a contentlength is not given.        note that the meaning of this field is significantly different from      the corresponding definition in mime, where it is an optional field      used within the ""message/externalbody"" contenttype. in http, it      should be sent whenever the message's length can be determined prior      to being transferred, unless this is prohibited by the rules in      section 4.4.    according to my research, both microsoft iis and lighttpd are strict on this. i have confirmed that lighttpd does not have a configuration option to disable this level of strictness. apache, however, is lax about enforcing this rule. as a result, apache works and lighttpd fails.    please correct the bamboo agent upload of artifacts to specify a contentlength according to the specification defined above so we can switch back to lighttpd.",2,train

somewhat started up but not responding to http requests. jira has started its plugins, and in the starting of the jira bamboo plugin, some code tries to eagerly instantiate something in bambooservermanagerimpl.java:          protected boolean isgadgetavailable(uri uri)                catch(ioexception e)                    finally                }      i.e. jira is waiting on bamboo to respond.    this should be fixed so that the attempted http connection at least has a sensible timeout (60seconds?) before it gives up and moves along. that, or instantiate things not on the startup of a plugin but at a different point in the lifecycle.",5,train

BAM-5358,Persist some calculated data for ArtifactLink,"from: https:/atlaseye.atlassian.com/cru/crbam997#c17472    chai:  is there any reason why we wouldn't simply store the calculated values? one of the things was that size was not calculated for directories in fear that it was going to be too expensive (which it can be if artifacts are big). thoughts?    krystian:  if we decide to persist the url then we shall remember to update it once the buildkey will get changed (build move) which in my opinion adds complexity. we can however store a path with some kind of token to be replaced by plankey while property is being read (""/browse/%s/artifacts/build 123/whatever"")  if you want to persist artifact size as well, then we might calculate directory size (as it would be done once).    chai:  yeah for url we could just store the calculated suffix (ie the thing that requires us to browse for an index.html etc) and leave out the prefix (that can just be apended, it's not expensive)  + we should store the full size for the directory, though it'd be good to do some testing to see if how much more time it adds (say for a clover report over jira is a good test)",2,train

BAM-6714,"Allow ""Import With Maven"" for ""Restricted Administrators""","we differentiate between system administrators and administrators in studio. system administrators are atlassian and contegix, administrators may be customers. i was told that these groups roughly map to the notion of administrators (studio: system administrators) and restricted administrators (studio: administrators) in bamboo.     the customer is allowed to perform certain administration tasks in studio's bamboo, amongst them f.e. to configure the build expiry (buildexpiryaction). these actions define no interceptor ref and thus use the defaultstack (defaultinterceptorref, xwork.xml). the defaultstack contains as far as i can see only one interceptor for authorisation, that is the permissioncheck (com.atlassian.bamboo.security.acegi.intercept.web.webworksecurityinterceptorproxy) interceptor which delegates to an extension of acegi's org.acegisecurity.intercept.abstractsecurityinterceptor, com.atlassian.bamboo.security.acegi.intercept.web.webworksecurityinterceptor. the abstractsecurityinterceptor is configured to check, amongst other things,  if principals trying to access   com.atlassian.bamboo.ww2.aware.permissions.globaladminsecurityaware instances possess one of these authorities: wwadmin,wwrestrictedadmin,globalread (applicationcontextacegisecurity.xml). the  administrative actions currently configured in studio to be accessible by restricted administrators (studio: administrators) implement this interface and thus they are allowed to access the action.    my current task is to allow customers to create build plans from poms (https:/studio.atlassian.com/browse/jst 2328). this action, importmavenplan (com.atlassian.bamboo.ww2.actions.admin.importmavenplancheckoutpomaction) uses a different interceptor stack, buildconfig and globaladminstackalwaysvalidate. regarding permissions, as far as i can see, the webworksecurityinterceptor is still used due to globaladminstackalwaysvalidate → basicadminstackprevalidate →  permissioncheck, but the principal is only checked against these authorities: wwread,globalread due to the instance being ""only"" a com.atlassian.bamboo.ww2.aware.permissions.globalreadsecurityaware (bambooactionsupport, see screenshot). the restricted administrators pass this test. however, a second permission check is applied in this configuration, the globaladminstackalwaysvalidate → basicadminstackprevalidate → globaladmin (com.atlassian.bamboo.ww2.interceptors.globaladmininterceptor). this interceptor uses the com.atlassian.bamboo.security.acegi.acls.hibernatemutableaclserviceimpl in order to check if the principal has the administration permission, which he has not (restrictedadministration instead).    my request is to change the configuration for the importmavenplan action in order to allow it to be used by restricted administrators. one way would be to use the default stack and implement globaladminsecurityaware. i haven't checked what other implications that would have regarding the interceptor configuration. thx for the help.",1,train

BAM-7291,Web repository isn't validating when configuring Plan.,"giles gaskell (at bamboo dev2 chatroom, 11/08/2010):    btw  just out of interest for the docs  when configuring the 'common repository configuration' options of an existing plan or job, i am able to select the option 'mercurial web repository' in the 'web repository' field for plan. however, this option is not available when configuring the equivalent field for a job.  is there a reason for that? or is this a bug?  does anyone have an answer as to why the 'mercurial web repository' option is not available when configuring a job? (whereas it is for a plan)  aha  i see what the issue is  when you're configuring a plan, the 'web repository' field does not appear to be validating your selected repository and the 'mercurial web repository' option appears no matter what repository type you select.      chai:    ah okay. that sounds like a bug      giles:    yeah  i thought so  fyi  the job configuration page appears to be working okay in this regard.          worth investigating. maybe it's a mercurial web repository issue itself. maybe not.",1,train

BAM-7531,Remove pre-2.0 upgrade tasks and provide protection against upgrade from pre 2.0 version,"krystian:  in the history of bamboo we had several versions which were required to be used to upgrade to the newer version. ie. to upgrade from bamboo 1.0 to bamboo 2.1 you need to execute upgrades to 1.1.2, 1.2 and 2.0.  the latest of this ""milestoneupgrade"" versions is 2.0. this is why i propose to drop all the upgrade tasks which were introduced by pre2.0 versions. the main benefit would be dropping the last usages of old and usually deprecated apis  according to https:/extranet.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageid=636158922 it means all pre 801 upgrade tasks (18 of them)    przemek:   make it impossible to use new bamboo version to upgrade from build number of pre2.0.x version.  that check should have been included in 2.0.x anyway...    marek:  1, those upgrade tasks are in sources too long. for historical stuff we got subversion    anton:  yes, if we do this, bamboo must lockup upon starting if it detects that it is being brought up against a version which is before 2.0.  we should also stop the user importing xml backups from pre 2.0 versions.  in all these cases the user should be given a very clear error message and no data should be changed.  can i ask why do you bring this up now? what caused you to do this? if we do this, will this simplify some other work we need to do for 3.0?  how long will the work of stopping a pre 2.0 upgrade/import take?    krystian:  adding protection against upgrade/import from pre2.0 version is rather simple and would require ~4h of work (including testing).  i'm bringing this now cause last week przemek has spotted a small bug which was caused by internal use of deprecated api (buildmanager). i thought that releasing 3.0 is a good moment to drop this (and maybe other) legacy apis which were deprecated in 2.7 and previous versions.  a lot of uses of deprecated api is buried in old upgrade tasks which led to idea i presented in my original email.  this will probably not simplify other work for 3.0 but has a potential to help us find forgotten usages of legacy code that should have been updated some time ago.",1,train

BAM-9674,"When retrying a release with the release management plugin, default plan variables displayed are not used in the build","we have a bamboo plan for our ""release"" which runs the mavenreleaseplugin to actually release our software.  we define the plan with two plan variables: ""thisversion"" and ""nextversion"".      steps to reproduce:  # go to a jira version for the project we want to release, go to the ""release"" tab, and click to release this jira version using the bamboo release plugin  # select ""release with new build"" and choose the correct bamboo plan (the release plan with the custom variables)  # click the link to type a value for the variable ""thisversion"" and enter a value of 1.1.0  # click the link to type a value for the variable ""nextversion"" and enter a value of 1.2.0.m1snapshot  # click release    the plan will fire.  if the plan fails, then it is displayed as failing in jira and there is a button to ""retry""    # click retry and the same release plugin popup will be displayed with the previously selected values already filled out except for these problems:     while there are two rows for each of the two plan variables we previously input, the variable name in the dropdown is the same for each.  it lists both variable names as ""nextversion"", even though we originally selected the drop downs as ""thisversion"" for the first, and ""nextversion"" for the second.   note that the correct values, however, are still present in the text boxes.  thus when you see the screen (and i forgot to get a screenshot) you see in the first row a select box with ""nextversion"" but with a value of 1.1.0.  and the second row has (again) ""nextversion"" in the drop down and the text box value of 1.2.0.m1snapshot.  thus, it persisted the text box values correctly but not the drop down selections correctly.   if you only change the value of the first drop down  i.e. change the first drop down from ""nextversion"" to ""thisversion"" (which is how we originally filled it out) and don't touch the second drop down box at all  then it will only set the ""thisversion"" plan variable (the drop down that we physically clicked and changed).  it will not submit the ""nextversion"" variable value to the plan, despite appearing exactly as it did when we originally filled out the form.    this of course made my plan fail a second time as the mavenrelease plugin needs the ""nextversion"" value, and since i don't have a default maven fails because the next version is """" (empty string).    i went back to the jira version > release page and ""retried"" a third time.  again i was presented with a form that had both drop downs displayed as ""nextversion"".  i clicked the first row drop down and changed it to to the correct ""thisversion"" variable.  then i clicked the second row (currently ""nextversion""), deliberately changed it to ""thisversion"" and then clicked again to change it back to ""nextversion"".  i left the text box values alone  as they were already correct.    i submitted this and it worked perfectly.    thus, by clicking the second row dropdown and changing it and changing it back is a valid workaround.  this seems pretty minor as there is an easy workaround and it seems to only be a problem whenever a release build fails, which is probably rare.",2,val
