DURACLOUD-4,Document logging framework,"store client: whenever used, creates a c:/ directory and several directories underneath it to store its log files.  sending logs to stdout by default and/or having a documented way to changes this would be good.",1,train
DURACLOUD-10,Allow for simple updating of project version numbers,it should be easy/simple to update the version number of all parts of the baseline for each release.,3,train
DURACLOUD-19,Bulk load: Verify successful DuraCloud ingest of 10TB of BHL content,nan,16,train

DURACLOUD-22,JPEG2K: Image server service,service wrapper and service to serve jpeg2k images.,5,train
DURACLOUD-23,JPEG2K: Image viewer service,service wrapper and service to display jpeg2k images.,3,train
DURACLOUD-25,Messaging: Add support for all DuraStore methods,add messaging support for all methods available through the durastore rest api. define an appropriate topic heirarchy.  example uses:  allows for a greater degree of replication filtering  allows for replication on update/delete   allows for creation of a provenance service ,3,train
DURACLOUD-28,Replication: handle replication on update/delete ,nan,3,train
DURACLOUD-29,Replication: bulk from existing store to new/empty store ,handles the replication of content from an existing store/space into a new store/space. this allows for starting up a new replicated store.,7,train
DURACLOUD-38,Security: Add application security (basic auth),nan,13,train
DURACLOUD-39,Indexing service for space/content properties/tags (Search) ,"this includes listening for changes to spaces/content and making the calls to have the information included in the search engine index. note that there needs to be a search engine started and available for this to work.  prior to working this task, a choice will need to be made as to the indexing tools used. the most likely candidates are aws cloudsearch (http:/aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch) and apache solr (http:/lucene.apache.org/solr/. various comparisons (http:/harish11g.blogspot.in/2012/12/amazoncloudsearchvsapachesolr.html) can be found to assist in this selection.  this task does not include updates to the ui or rest api to support users querying the index.  ",8,train
DURACLOUD-41,Integrity: check on demand (rely on DuraCloud generated hashes) ,should allow for after ingest checksum validation. test case: use to validate a replicated content store.,13,train
DURACLOUD-60,Allow expected checksum value to be included when adding a content item,update the durastore rest api call for storing a content item to allow for including an md5 checksum value which is compared with the stored file's checksum to ensure that the file was received correctly.,2,train
DURACLOUD-61,Handle files larger than 5GB,"amazon s3 limits files size to 5gb, but many of our customers will want to store files larger than this. durastore should facilitate this by handling the chunking of large files into smaller files during transfer. files will need to be stitched back together on download as well. ideally this will all be transparent to the user, even as far as multiple files appearing as one in the space listing (with the proper total file size.)  ",3,train
DURACLOUD-62,Enable Pax-logging,"as the use of the osgi container and paxtooling increases, it is important that the container enables the configuration of bundlelevel logging.  resources: http:/ekkescorner.wordpress.com/2009/09/03/osgiloggingpart2logservicesvsclassiclogger/ http:/fedoracommons.org/jira/browse/fcrepo 630",2,train
DURACLOUD-63,Production AMI continuous integration testing,a suite of automated tests should be created to run on a schedule that:  start instances of production amis  check the tabs/fields/buttons of duradmin  start/verify each service  verify content actions ,5,train
DURACLOUD-64,Update the development AMI,"update the tomcat user in the development ami to allow calling of aptget via sudo with no password. steps:  call 'visudo'  add this line to the end of the file: tomcat  all=nopasswd:/usr/bin/aptget  also, add any necessary systemproperties for enabling servicesutil to initialize $bundle.home  ",1,train
DURACLOUD-65,Create utility for durastore & duraservice initialization,nan,1,train
DURACLOUD-66,Initialize servicesadmin $bundle.home at runtime,"currently $bundle.home is a buildtime configuration item. since the deployment machine will likely have a different setup than any particular build machine, it would be useful to allow $bundle.home to be set at runtime. note: this has been avoided in the past by building the deployed projects on the deployment machine.  solutions may potentially be:  initialize from rest call  initialize from ~/file baked into ami   initialize from system property (most tempting)",1,train
DURACLOUD-68,Integrate j2k viewer with duradmin content browse,"although the j2k viewer is currently enabled, it needs to be tied to the duradmin content browse in order to be useful for jpeg2000 content.",3,train
DURACLOUD-69,Modularize project builds,"in an attempt to isolate fundamental aspects of the baseline in terms of building and testing, this task is to create three toplevel pom.xml that separate: storage services infrastructure  bamboo builds should be created to run each.",1,train
DURACLOUD-70,Cannot upload empty content,"while testing akubra duracloud (vs duracloud trunk r438), i noticed that anytime i attempt to send an empty stream to contentstore.addcontent(..), it behaves as though the request succeeded (no exception is thrown), but the content item never actually gets created in s3.  here's what i've verified so far: 1) s3 supports uploading empty items (verified via s3fox) 2) contentstore supports listing, getting, and deleting empty items (tested after uploading an empty item into my test space using s3fox) 3) duradmin reports an error (400) when attempting to upload an empty file, but is able to successfully list, get, and delete empty files.  ",1,train
DURACLOUD-71,IA Filesystem Checksum Verifier,this utility needs to:  walk a directory of downloaded ia books  generate checksums for each file  read iamanifest of provided checksums (/_files.xml)   compare generated to provided checksums,1,train
DURACLOUD-72,content browser: previous link takes the user to the first page.,nan,1,train
DURACLOUD-74,Create EMC accounts for each pilot partner,in order to allow our partners to use emc storage during the pilot we need to: 1. create an emc account for each partner 2. add the emc credentials to the durastore initialization for each partner,1,train
DURACLOUD-75,Large-file chunking in durastore,this feature should accept large streams coming in from the durastorerestapi and chunk them into duracloud.,3,train
DURACLOUD-76,Large-file stitching in durastore,this feature should accept requests for large streams coming in from the durastorerestapi and stitch the duracloud chunks into a single response stream.,3,train
DURACLOUD-80,display thumbnails in content browser,nan,1,train
DURACLOUD-81,Update Rackspace Java library,"a few issues have been resolved in the rackspace java library based on submitted support tickets. the most current library needs to be added, and rackspacestorageprovider needs to be updated to account for the fixes.",1,train
DURACLOUD-82,Large-file stitching as client-side utility,nan,3,train
DURACLOUD-86,Limit count of space items in space metadata,"the current call to get space metadata performs a count of the number of items in a space. for s3, this requires getting a list of the entire set of content and counting the included items. when there is a large number of item in the space, this can take quite a while (around 4 minutes for 250,000 objects). rather than performing this count every time the metadata is requested for a space, the count should be capped and a value returned which indicates that there is a large number of objects. as an example, if the cap for counting is 1000 items, a value of ""1000+"" could be returned when the cap is reached.  along with this cap, there needs to be a way to get the actual content count. this would likely work best as a client side count, since the client would be able to update its display to indicate that the count is proceeding.",1,train
DURACLOUD-91,Out of memory error on uploading large files through duradmin.,try uploading three files > 20 mb   tomcat should throw an oom error.,2,train
DURACLOUD-93,Convert to use SLF4J consistently for logging,"there is currently a mix of log4j, commonslogging, and slf4j in the baseline. the log4j and commonslogging dependencies (including transitive dependencies) need to be pulled out in favor of slf4j. a good reference point is chris wilper's completed task doing the same thing in the fedora baseline: http:/fedoracommons.org/jira/browse/fcrepo630",3,train
DURACLOUD-94,Conversion service cleanup not always happening,"in the conversion service, if the call to add the converted file to storage fails, neither the converted file nor the original are removed from the work directory. this cleanup should occur regardless of whether conversion or upload succeed.  additionally, it would be a good idea to add a retry to the upload call.",1,train
DURACLOUD-95,Service Jars should be kept out of the service work directory,"in servicesutil, specifically serviceinstallerimpl.explodeandinstall(), when a service package zip is unpacked, any jars which are found to already be deployed are being placed in the service's work directory. instead the jar count should just be incremented (as is done already) and the jar ignored.",1,train
DURACLOUD-96,Unable to add metadata to a content item when the metadata name includes a space,"when attempting to add metadata to a content item, if the name of the metadata includes a space, the add fails. there is no failure message, but the metadata is not added to the content metadata list.   this issue does not show up when adding metadata to a space.  update: this issue was resolved for amazon, but in rackspace a similar problem still exists. on rackspace, if metadata is added to a content item in which the metadata name includes a space, it appears to work properly, but on refresh, that item will disappear.",2,train
DURACLOUD-97,Updating the MIME type of a content item to an invalid MIME value causes errors,if you update the mime type of a content item to an invalid value (such as imagejpeg) an exception is thrown: java.lang.illegalargumentexception: error parsing media type 'imagejpg'. the item can then not be accessed via the rest api (and consequently the ui). there should be a validation check in durastore (and duradmin) to make sure that the value provided as a mime type is acceptable.,1,train
DURACLOUD-98,Progress bar for uploading content items in duradmin,"right now, adding a content item ",1,train
DURACLOUD-101,Create utility to sync to DuraCloud from the filesystem,"this can be used to sync arbitrary file system directories with duracloud, storing new and updated files. one use case for this is direct backup of fedora and dspace file content to duracloud (archive to duracloud without needing to talk directly.)  see http:/fedora commons.org/confluence/x/lwaiaq for more detail",16,train
DURACLOUD-102,Add option to set color space in Image Conversion service,nypl images are in prorgb format and need to be converted to srgb as part of the process of converting tiff images to jp2. this task is to include the option to indicate the preferred target colorspace in the call to perform the image conversion. this option will need to be included as a config item when deploying the service.,2,train
DURACLOUD-103,Ability for account-admin to add image/mark-up to duradmin home page,the goal of this feature is to allow for duradmin to include the branding of the organization using duracloud.,1,train
DURACLOUD-104,Handle access control at the DuraCloud level rather than depending on storage providers,"access control as it exists in version 0.2 of duracloud is handled by using the acl and other access mechanisms of the underlying storage providers to allow or disallow direct access to content items in those provider stores. as it has been decided that duracloud should always mediate content access, access control should be managed within duracloud. having an open space will allow anonymous read access to content through the duracloud interfaces, whereas having a closed space will allow access only to authorized users.",2,train
DURACLOUD-106,Security: Add application support for transport security (ssl/tls),this issue is to enable the baseline to handle both http and https requests.,8,train
DURACLOUD-107,Security: Update PP AMI,nan,3,train
DURACLOUD-111,Video Streaming Service - Amazon Impl,this service should expose video content through amazon's cloud front streaming server.,8,train
DURACLOUD-114,Multi-thread the Image Conversion Service ,update the image conversion service to be able to spin up a set of threads to handle the conversion process.,2,train
DURACLOUD-115,Image Conversion Service should write output more frequently,the process for reporting image conversion results should be updated so that the output file is created and continually updated as the conversion activity progresses. this makes it is possible to review the results even while the service is running and makes results available even if the service does not complete properly.,2,train
DURACLOUD-118,Stylize 'logout' button,"with the addition of security on duradmin, a logout button has been added to the base header.jsp. it needs to be properly formatted/stylized.",1,train

DURACLOUD-122,Display Generic filetype icon in contents view when jpg2000 service not available.,nan,2,train
DURACLOUD-123,Implement Browser side caching for space and item metadata,nan,3,train
DURACLOUD-126,Create content retrieval tool,this tool is the complement to the sync tool: a command line utility which would be used to pull content from a duracloud space to the local file system. part of that activity is reconstituting any chunked files.,4,train
DURACLOUD-127,Duraservice REST-API: shorten /duraservice/services to /duraservice,nan,1,train
DURACLOUD-128,Anonymous StoreClient,"the contentstoremanagerimpl needs to be updated to allow anonymous users to have read access to content.  notes from skype: [12:26:26] bill branan:  the primary store is queried so that a contentstoreimpl can be created with a storageprovidertype and a storeid. we could pass in storageprovidertype.unknown and storeid as null. the addstoreidqueryparameter() method would need to check for null before adding the query param. if it's null, the param is just not included, and durastore reads that as ""use the primary store"" [12:27:42] andrew woods: where is your entry point? [12:28:47] bill branan: a new public method on contentstoremanagerimpl, getcontentstoreasanonymous() or something",1,train
DURACLOUD-129,Add refresh button to flush clientside cache,nan,1,train
DURACLOUD-130,Investigate sojo dependency,"hello danny, i have noticed there have been a couple of build failures due to a new dependency of duradmin that apparently is not always available from its hosting maven repository, namely, net.sf.sojo:sojooptional:jar:0.5.0. it looks like this is a transitive dependency that was pulled in recently through: net.sf.springjson:spring json:jar:1.3.0.  would you be able to do some testing to see if duradmin actually needs this dependency or not. if we do need it, then we can pull it into our own duraspace maven repository. since it probably is a runtime dependency with the ajax tooling, could you remove it from your local maven repository, place an exclude element in your duradmin pom.xml, and run through the application to see if it is actually being used anywhere? ...and naturally double check you local repository to make sure it did not slip back in.  thanks, andrew  p.s. i am planning on putting up a new page/form in duradmin that allows for showing/adding/removing/updating security users. once the initial page is in the baseline, could you go through and make it usable and presentable? we can talk at length later. ",1,train
DURACLOUD-131,Update EMC libraries and re-introduce to baseline,"the emc storage provider is currently excluded from tests and use because of very inconsistent performance around the time that emc was in the process of taking their storage service into production. they have, hopefully, addressed these problems. the client libraries for emc need to be updated to the most recent version, our code needs to be updated to work with the latest libraries, and our the tests and use of the emc provider needs to be re enabled.",2,train
DURACLOUD-132,Application Initialization tool,"as the initialization process for duracloud becomes increasingly involved, tooling support would be helpful. this tool should:  read all configuration from a properties files for durastore, duraservice, duradmin, and security  initialize each of the three webapps   set security users on each of the three webapps",3,train
DURACLOUD-133,REST-ful initialization of duradmin,currently the only way to initialize duradmin is through the ui: duradmin/init.htm this improvement should allow initialization through an http call.,1,train
DURACLOUD-134,Propagate duradmin security updates to durastore & duraservice,"when updates to security users happens on the duradmin ui, those changes need to be pushed to durastore and duraservice.",1,train
DURACLOUD-135,Handle XML in a consistent way throughout the DuraCloud baseline,"duracloud currently uses xml in many places and there are serveral tools and methods used for validating and parsing the xml into an object model. the first step is to pull each bit of xml generation/parsing/validating code into its own class, passing back objects that can be used by the other parts of the code. this will make it easier to re factor the xml handling into a standard method.  we should consider which tool(s) provides the best set of features and use it consistently. we should also have a standard method for validation, relax ng should be considered here.",5,train
DURACLOUD-140,Error viewing files in DurAdmin space listing,"to replicate: add the attached file (which includes a  in the file name) to a space. view the space using duradmin. the request appears to fail to get metadata for the new file, so its link is removed and replaced with: unable to complete request: status (200)  if you click on the link before it disappears, everything appears as it should, the metadata is displayed, and the file can be viewed or downloaded.  note that this problem appears to occur when any of these characters show up in the contentid: ,"", #, %, &  so a couple of questions here:  what's causing the failure when retrieving metadata?  why does the link to the item disappear when the metadata can't be retrieved?  as a side note, if you select a content item to view on the space page before the metadata for all content items has loaded, all content items in the list turn into error messages. the content page loads shortly after this, so things get back to normal, but it may appear to a user that they have done something wrong by clicking on a content link.",2,train
DURACLOUD-143,Be able to embed J2K viewer in local hosted application,"users would like to view their jpeg2000 images in j2k image server, wrapped in their own ui/portal.  images and image server would be hosted from duracloud.",1,train
DURACLOUD-144,Provide users of the Image Conversion service with feedback/status regarding the time that will be required to complete a conversion task,nan,5,train
DURACLOUD-145,Duraservice: messaging,"this feature is analogous duracloud 25, except it calls for applying publishing of messaging events across duraservice methods.",4,train
DURACLOUD-149,ServicesAdmin: Clear registered services,"this improvement should provide a restful means of clearing the ""registered services"" from servicesadmin's cache. this would facilitate bringing duraservice and servicesadmin back into sync.",3,train
DURACLOUD-150,DurAdmin: Warning on overwrite,"when using duradmin, users should be notified when adding a content item will overwrite an existing file.",1,train
DURACLOUD-152,Disable unused projects,this issue should disable /duradavwebapp from the build and remove /sunstorageprovider,1,train
DURACLOUD-153,UI Facelift,nan,5,train
DURACLOUD-154,Release AMI,this tracker item is a container for all items that should be included in the 0.4 ami.    redirect / to /duradmin,3,train
DURACLOUD-155,Project Version in batch scripts,"this issue is a followon to durcloud10 which enabled true project version numbers in the duracloud baseline. this issue is to enable those version numbers to be ""sourced"" from a common .bat file (ala /resources/scripts/osgi/env.sh & /services/j2kservice/run deps.sh)",1,train
DURACLOUD-156,License Boiler Plates,before going open source. the baseline needs to be updated to include the proper licensing info.,1,train
DURACLOUD-157,Refactor: StorageProviderFactory & TaskProviderFactory,"in order to be able to leverage spring for it ioc, aop, etc, across these classes (and a chain of classes below them that follow a similar pattern) as well as to more easily unit test them by injecting mocks, this jira item is to refactor these classes from being comprised of static methods and then use the spring framework to inject them into their respective  rest.java counterparts.",1,train
DURACLOUD-158,Change Sync Tool default port,"the default port for the sync tool is 8080, it should be 443 to allow it to be used by customers without having to set the port to 80 or 443.",1,train
DURACLOUD-159,Provide a way to make use of Amazon's Reduced Redundancy Storage,"amazon's reduced redundancy storage provides a lower cost cloud storage solution. we should add a task which will set content in a space to use this type of storage (and get it back to standard storage.) we could potentially also add a service to allow users to do this directly, but that should be in another tracker item.",2,train
DURACLOUD-160,Create file-based credential store for unit tests,"replace the current unittestdb with a filebased method for storing and retrieving storage provider credentials. this new method will need to be able to handle storage files which are and which are not encrypted.    developers should be able to keep a local file (perhaps pointed to by maven settings) which includes all of the account credentials needed for testing. they should be able to choose to encrypt this file or not. working with an unencrypted file is simpler for local development. using an encrypted file will allow for more secure storage and for simpler sharing among developers. (the key needed to enc/dec could be stored in maven settings as it is now for the db.)  we may choose to pass an encryped credentials file into bamboo in order to be able to update the test accounts (and keys) without needing to rebuild the ami.  it seems likely that we can reuse the code in appconfig to actually read the credentials file, assuming the same format as an appconfig file. we should also be able to use the encryptionutil in common to handle the encryption/decryption (in combination with commonsio fileutils.readfiletostring()). there should be an assembly which provides an easy cli to encrypt and decrypt a file.",3,train
DURACLOUD-161,Transition to using S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage for all pilot S3 storage,transition all current s3 objects to use rrs. update the s3storageprovider to use rrs as the default. one way to do this would be to add a task which sets a flag within the s3storageprovider indicating the preferred storage setting for s3.,3,train
DURACLOUD-163,Add config element for duraservice service-registry store credentials,this item should add a new config element to duraservice for the username/password needed to get services from the dcprod serviceregistry store. currently these credentials are coming from the hijacked config elements: duraservice.servicecompute.username duraservice.service compute.password ,1,train
DURACLOUD-164,500 response from durastore: Too many open files,"after uploading some 1gb files to the wgbh release0.3 instance, durastore would only respond with a 500 exception. the tomcat log files (attached) indicate ""java.net.socketexception: too many open files"" the lsof.out shows an excess of open socket connections to the instance itself. it may be related to the jets3t library (?).",3,train

DURACLOUD-341,Duplication on Demand destination space,"when configuring the duplication on demand service, if you leave the destination space name blank, the service should automatically create the destination space with the source space's name.  carissa ran the service leaving the destination space blank (assuming this would occur) and the service ran to completion... service status read: ""complete"" but no duplicated content was to be found.",1,train
DURACLOUD-342,Bulk Image Transformer output to be standard CSV format,"currently the output for the bulk image transformer is in a modified csv format, similar to: name1=value1, name2=value2, name3=value3, ...  this task is to update the output to be in standard csv format: value1, value2, value3  the first line in the file should a header which indicates the names of the values to follow: name1, name2, name3  the bulk bit integrity service produces this format by allowing the hadoop reducer to produce all of the value lines, then using a post processor to insert the name line at the top.",2,train

DURACLOUD-400,DuraStore REST API: text/plain response from getSpaces,"just an inconsistency i noticed while looking at the rest api. this particular method gives a response contenttype header of ""text/plain"". most other methods that return xml declare their contenttype as text/xml.  for example:  https:/demo.duracloud.org/durastore/spaces?storeid=0  ...gives text/plain, but:  https:/demo.duracloud.org/durastore/cwilper test?storeid=0  ...gives text/xml.",1,train
DURACLOUD-401,Use application/xml as response Content-Type for XML-returning REST API methods,"most of the rest api methods that return xml today use text/xml, but application/xml is a actually a better choice due to character encoding issues:  according to the specification of the text/ media types (rfc2046), if a charset parameter is not specified in the declaration of mime type (at the end of the contenttype value, ala ""text/xml; charset=utf8"", it must be assumed that the body is encoded in usascii.  the ""encoding"" declared in the xml declaration is supposed to be ignored.  here are a couple online posts that further explain the problem:    http:/annevankesteren.nl/2005/03/textxml    http:/  it's clearly the intent that duracloud rest api methods that return xml are encoded in utf8 (because the xml declaration says so), but according to the standards, because text/xml is used instead of application/xml, and the contenttype is not declared with a ""charset=utf8"" mime parameter, the xml declaration is supposed to be ignored by clients and they should assume usascii.",1,train
DURACLOUD-402,Allow for local service repository,it is currently required that the service repository for a duracloud instance be hosted on another duracloud instance. this task is to allow the service repository to be hosted within the same instance. this will both simplify the deployment of stand alone duracloud instances (for users of the open source platform) and lead the way toward allowing multiple service repositories to be associated with a single instance.,1,train
DURACLOUD-403,Improve binary installation package,"in the 0.9 release the first binary installation package was created. this allows system admins to deploy an instance of duracloud without needing to build from source. this was a good first step, but there are a few pieces which could make the process smoother:   include wars with names that do not include version. when the jars are dropped into tomcat with the release version included in the file name, they are not deployed to the expected context path (i.e. rather than a context path of /durastore it is instead /durastore/. the installation package zip file includes the version number, this should be sufficient.  include the appconfig jar, as this is needed to configure the instance.  include an example properties file to be used with appconfig.jar for instance initialization.  include a default/example logback.xml file which can be used within the service bundle home.  update included run.bat file to properly pick up environment variables in a windows environment  allow for the use of a local service repository (handled by duracloud402)   update the included readme.txt file to have complete instructions for standing up a duracloud instance using the files provided with the installation package. parts of this document can refer to the wiki for further explanation, but ideally, the entire process would be well enough defined in the readme such that the links to the wiki would be optional reading.",1,train
DURACLOUD-404,Duraservice: clean re-initialization,"currently, when reinitializing duraservice, due to caching, some elements do not take on the new reinitialize values. this improvement is to determine and implement what is required to make duraservice re initialization work as if it were being initialized from scratch.",1,train

DURACLOUD-410,Use Amazon multi-part upload for large files,"this task is to update the s3storageprovider to make use of amazon's multipart upload option for s3 when content is large enough to require chunking. this would mean that rather than storing our chunked file parts (and associated manifest) in s3, we would use the multipart tools to push up the pieces and assemble them again in s3.  since the md5 for the entire chunked file is not available from s3, we will need to calculate it on transfer and store it as metadata.",5,train
DURACLOUD-416,Implement a content cache to mitigate eventual consistency issues,"in order to make the issues of eventual consistency an issue that does not concern the users of duracloud, durastore should be updated to provide a cache for the content which is stored. this could mean either storing the file locally first, then making the call to push it to the provider, or wrapping the stream in order to write the file locally while it is being stored at the provider. these local files would be used to fulfill get requests that come in shortly after the file has been stored. the files in the cache would be removed once there is a greater degree of certainty that the file will be available on all following requests to the provider (perhaps just after a certain time period has elapsed.)  note that one benefit to storing the files locally prior to pushing them to the provider would be that we could know the file size and generate the checksum locally before making the provider request, meaning that we could ensure that the file reached durastore correctly before passing it along to the next location. this may also become useful for handling large files that we intend to pass to the provider using a multi part upload.",5,train

DURACLOUD-513,Distill failed items from a failed service run,this improvement is to extract out the failed items from the output report of unsuccessful service runs in order to make the errors more clear for the user. the implementation will likely require updates in the reporting ui as well as in the underlying service infrastructure. ,3,train
DURACLOUD-514,Filter administrative content from storage reports,"this improvement is to by default only expose the user content in the ui storage reports. the administrative content to be filter is currently found in the following spaces:  xduracloudadmin  xserviceout  xservice work  the implementation may be done at the time of report statistics collection or in the ui, toggling admin spaces on/off.

DURACLOUD-515,Make parameters consistent among command line utilities,"this task is to make command line options as uniform as possible among the current set of command line utilities: sync tool, retrieval tool, chunker, stitcher. there are currently several inconsistencies that need to be cleaned up:   use c for content directory (as used by sync and retrieval tools). currently stitcher uses d and chunker uses a compound a option  the chunker should support i (storeid)  the chunker should use s (spaceid) rather than including it as part of a  the chunker should use h (host) and r (port) rather than  c",2,train
DURACLOUD-516,Service output files to use .tsv extension and text/tab-separated-values mime type,this task is to update the service output files to have mime type of text/tabseparatedvalues and .tsv extension,2,train
DURACLOUD-517,Undeploy service should have warning,"this issue should address the apparent lack of an ""ok""/""cancel"" warning when undeploying a service. currently, when the user selects ""undeploy"", the service is simply undeployed without a warning notice.",1,train
DURACLOUD-518,Service properties blank on deploy,"this issue is to address the situation where a user deploys a service, and when it has successfully deployed, the ""service detail"" panel goes blank. the ""service detail"" panel should show the properties of the newly deployed service.",1,train
DURACLOUD-519,Sync Tool should ensure configuration for subsequent runs is functionally equivalent before attempting to restart,"when the sync tool starts up, it compares the current configuration with the previous configuration to determine if it can perform a restart. a restart allows the sync tool to not attempt to re sync all of the files in the content directory. the problem is that the check to see if a restart is possible (in synctool.restartpossible()) only checks the list of content directories. it should actually compare host, spaceid, storeid, and syncdeletes values as well. if any of those values do not match, a clean start should occur.",1,train
DURACLOUD-520,StorageProvider to support add-content-with-metadata,"this improvement is to investigate and potentially implement an update to the storageprovider.addcontent() interface method or an addition of a parallel addcontent() method that optionally takes objectproperties along with the contentstream.  as an example, the current contentrest.addcontent() method performs two calls to the storageprovider: addcontent() & setcontentproperties(). the number of calls made to the underlying storage provider could be cut in half if these two calls were combined.  the amazons3client interface, the rackspace filesclient, and the azure iblobcontainer all support calls for including metadata along with the call for adding content.",3,train
DURACLOUD-521,Media Streamer: set logging level down from WARN,this improvement is to set the log level of messages in the mediastreamservice to info or debug from the current warn. ,1,train
DURACLOUD-522,StoreClient encryption support,this feature is to provide a means for users to encrypt/decrypt content stored and retrieved through the storeclient.  the storeclient should have a constructor that optionally takes a symmetric or asymmetric encryption key.,3,train
DURACLOUD-523,SDSC Storage Provider integration,this feature is to integrate the sdsc cloud as another underlying storageprovider.,3,train
DURACLOUD-525,Auto-user application,this feature is to provide the ability to start a duracloud instance with a set list of services that will be run on a set schedule. the first example of such an autorun/scheduled service is bitintegrity.,4,train
DURACLOUD-526,UI - Copy multiple content item across storage providers,"this feature is to expose the copycontentacrossstorageproviders functionality within duradmin. this needs to include the option to ""multiselect"" content items to be copied as well as only selecting a single item.  likely this will be an addition to the existing content copy ui element. the interface should optionally allow the user to indicate the destination storageprovider.",2,train
DURACLOUD-527,Content manifest,"this feature is to create and maintain a manifest (spaceid, contentid, md5) of all content held in the primary storage provider. a listener should update the manifest whenever content is added or deleted from durastore. the format of the manifest should be compatible with the expected input format of the bit integrity service.",3,train
DURACLOUD-528,Migrate SCM to Git,this task is to migrate the duracloud scm from subversion to git.,5,train
DURACLOUD-532,Rename spaces,"this task is to make it possible for users to rename duracloud spaces. in order to do this, space names will need to no longer be directly tied to the bucket/container names of the underlying storage provider. one way to do this is for the name of a space to become a property of that space. a side benefit of this is that we should be able to remove many of the naming limitations we currently have on space names.",5,train
DURACLOUD-533,Archive-It Integration,this feature is to provide an integration with archiveit so that users with archiveit content may seamlessly push their collection into duracloud.,5,train
DURACLOUD-534,UI - Provide hierarchical content view,"duradmin should be able to graphically display folder and file hierarchies in a similar fashion that is available on a local machine. currently, the naming convention to indicate hierarchical files (ex. folder1/folder2/folder3/filename.txt) is not sufficient from a user perspective. it is expected that the interface will allow them to create ""sub folders"" or spaces within spaces, etc. that will map to the local directories that the content was stored in.  this task is to update the display of content items such that the user sees the commonly expected folder structure, which allows navigation down to files. this should look pretty similar to the display provided for content in s3 by the aws console.",8,train
DURACLOUD-537,Long-running content actions,"this task is to add support in durastore for longrunning actions that can be run over content. some examples of these kinds of tasks are: multifile delete, multifile copy (within and between providers), and multifile property add/update/delete. it may make sense to implement this feature using the existing tasks infrastructure.",5,train

DURACLOUD-544,Automatically insert logo in x-duracloud-admin,"when a duracloud instance is deployed, it should automatically include a logo in the xduracloudadmin space, so that the logs don't get junked up. i have attached a possible logo to use for this purpose.",1,train
DURACLOUD-545,Implement an automated performance testing framework,assemble a framework for automated performance testing to fit into the duracloud software engineering process. this framework is to include tests and test data sets. it will be implemented incrementally in an agile fashion.  the primary goal of performance testing is to ensure that duracloud meets its goals for scalability and reliability. it characterizes the performance of the system under various load scenarios. it is also a primary input for bottleneck analysis that can be used to improve system performance. performance tests often overlap functional tests and are useful for ensuring that duracloud is functioning as documented. performance testing is also used to help size and manage the operating infrastructure in order to avoid unnecessary costs. these costs are part of the information needed to set the price of our services.,5,train
DURACLOUD-546,Update Sync Tool to take advantage of improvements due to the Upload Tool,the creation of the upload tool included several backend changes to the sync tool. this task is to make improvements to the frontend of the sync tool to:  display the progress of file transfers when printing status  allow for individual files to be watched as well as directories,2,train
DURACLOUD-547,Upload tool applet cannot be used at the same time on spaces of the same name on different providers,"if you are using the upload tool via duradmin to perform an upload on amazon in space ""test"", you cannot also perform an upload to a space with the same name in another provider   you are sent to the existing upload window.",1,train
DURACLOUD-548,ACL: Create UI for managing ACL users/groups during space administration,"this feature is to create a ui in duradmin for managing spacelevel acls. it will likely be a button in the righthand pane, similar to the ""edit"" button for space metadata. the functionality should enable admins to add/remove 'users' and/or 'groups' to the space acl with permissions of 'read' or 'write' (which implies read). a potentially attractive ui widget would be the one that renders two, sideby side boxes containing usernames, and arrows allowing the moving of usernames from one box to the other.

DURACLOUD-551,Space and content list reload,"please add a refresh button to the space listing as well as to the content listing within a space. currently a space is not reloaded after content items are added, and a user must either (a) reload their entire browser window or (b) click on the space tab and renavigate to the appropriate space to see the newly added content items.",1,train
DURACLOUD-553,ACL: Update app-config and security-user bean to include 'group' details,"this update is to modify appconfig, securityuserbean, and securityusers.xsd, as appropriate to support the inclusion of acl 'groups' during instance initialization.",1,train
DURACLOUD-554,ACL: Add ACLStorageProvider,this feature is to add a new storageprovider wrapper implementation to facilitate filtering the spaces listed in a getspaces() request. the primary objectives are to:  provide a way to only return spaces that are either 'open' or are accessible to the calling user  improve performance so that each request for the space listing does not require querying the properties of each space from the underlying storage provider.  below are some implementation suggestions:  1. in storageproviderfactoryimpl.getstorageprovider()          wrap storageprovider with a new aclstorageprovider()  2. aclstorageprovider          overwrite: getspaces()           cache spaces and space acl properties ,2,train
DURACLOUD-555,ACL: Enable multi-map content/space properties,"this feature is to enable multi map header values throughout the application for content and space properties. the capability should be enabled for the entire stack: storageproviders, to rest, to storeclient, to duradmin.",2,train

DURACLOUD-557,ACL: Update duradmin UI to exclude tabs from USER role,"this update is to not display the ""services"" tab nor the reports tabs under ""dashboard"" if the user who is logged into duradmin only has roleuser. rather, only users with roleadmin should be able to see the services and reports tabs.",1,train
DURACLOUD-558,ACL: Represent space access (open/closed) as an ACL,"this improvement is to refactor the implementation of space access from the 'spaceaccess' property to an acl property (aclgroup public). in addition to cleaning up specialized logic for space access, handling space access as an acl will allow a single call to the underlying storage providers to be made in determining access rights in spring security instead of a call for space access and a separate call for space acls.

DURACLOUD-561,Deprecate space-access methods,this improvement is to deprecate the setspaceaccess and getspaceaccess methods on the storageprovider and contentstore interfaces.,1,train
DURACLOUD-563,Provide a REST call to allow administrators to retrieve a listing of all users and groups,"in order to be able to create an acl for a space, an administrative user needs to list all of the users and groups which should have access to the space. what makes this hard is that there's no way via the rest api for an administrator to get a list of the users and groups which are available. so while the acl can be created currently, knowing how to fill it out is a challenge.  this task is to add a call to the rest api which allows administrators to retrieve a listing of all users and groups, as well as which users are parts of which group.",3,train
DURACLOUD-565,Sort permissions display,"this task is to sort the listing of items in the permissions section of the content item display in duradmin.  groups should be displayed above users, and both sets should be sorted alphabetically (a z). the ""public"" group, when added, should always be displayed at the top of the list.",1,train
DURACLOUD-566,Handle space properties cache loading on instance initialization,"currently, the cache for space properties is loaded the first time a user attempts to access a storage provider. if this user is a non admin user, and there are many spaces in the account, this action can take several minutes. this task is to transition to loading the cache when the instance is first initialized, rather than waiting for a user to access the instance, greatly lowering the likelihood that any user will have to wait while the cache is populated.",2,train

DURACLOUD-568,Multi-space property editing:  User should be alerted if they are trying to update one or more readonly spaces.,"suppose a user is looking at a list of four spaces and suppose he has write access to only three of them. currently the set of editable tags and properties is gathered from all selected spaces regardless of whether the user has write access. similarly if a user tries to add properties or tags to a selected space to which he has only read only access, the system won't handle it very beautifully.    the ideal solution would be to disallow selection of unwritable spaces.",2,train
DURACLOUD-569,Create Messaging over setSpaceACLs(),this improvement is to add messaging over the durastore calls to storageprovider.setspaceacls(). the configuration for this is in: durastore/src/main/webapp/webinf/config/aopconfig.xml a new advisor (ala spaceupdateadvice) will needed to be created as well.,1,train

DURACLOUD-574,Remove Duradmin's dependency on the Space Access APIs in storeclient,remove the dependencies on space access by having duradmin use the acls instead.  it is also necessary to make it clear to the user how to enable public access on a space if no public acl has been set. additionally the public group should be highlighted in the ui to amplify its uniqueness. ,2,train
DURACLOUD-575,Synctool: not re-syncing content deleted from DuraCloud,"this issue is to fix the bug demonstrated in the following scenario: # run synctool pushing one or more files to a space  observe success # delete one of the content items in duracloud newly pushed to the space # rerun the synctool  observe deleted item is not reuploaded  the strategy to fix this issue is to introduce a new flag which instructs the sync tool to perform a ""clean start"" rather than a re start, so that all files in all local directories are considered as part of the sync. this flag would essentially have the same effect as clearing the work directory prior to starting the sync tool. the flag should not be enabled by default.",1,train

DURACLOUD-621,Display bit integrity results on each space,"services are being automated and users are no longer required to run the bit integrity service themselves, but they still need to know that their content is being verified. this task is to include on the ui, likely in the space details area, an indication of when the most recent successful bit integrity check was run over the content in that space.  in the event that the most recent bit integrity check resulted in an error, we (duracloud staff) will need the opportunity to investigate the issue and correct it if possible before the issue is displayed to the user (this may also be done in an automated fashion.) if it turns out that the error requires user intervention, then it would be nice to be able to have that be indicated in some way on the ui, calling out specifically which files need to be addressed.",2,train
DURACLOUD-622,Refactor RackspaceStorageProvider to OpenStackStorageProvider,"this improvement is to refactor the rackspacestorageprovider to openstackstorageprovider. since we currently have three storage providers that all expose an openstack api, the rackspacestorageprovider (which is coded to the openstack api) should now be abstracted up as the base class of the three implementations: rackspace, sdsc, and hp. each of these inheriting classes should have their own names displayed in error and logging messages.",1,train

DURACLOUD-738,Java 7 support,"this task is to transition duracloud to be built and run using java 7. there are a few reasons for this transition:  1. oracle has announced that java 6 will hit endoflife in nov 2012 (http:/ 2. java 7 has been available for over a year, and is becoming more prevalent 3. java 7 has new capabilities. one specific need is the capability (in nio) to read/write file creation, modification, and access timestamps 4. we need to support customer use of java 7 with our clientside tools (e.g. sync tool)",3,val
DURACLOUD-739,Timestamp collection utility,"this task is to create a utility which can loop through a set of directories and capture the timestamp information (creation date, modified date, access date) on each of the included files. that timestamp info should be written to a file (so that it can be archived locally) as well as written as metadata to each files's corresponding duracloud content item. (the expectation here being that the sync tool has already done the work of moving each file to duracloud.)  the capability to capture time stamp information was added to the nio package in java 7 (http:/docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/attribute/basicfileattributes.html), thus this utility will need to be built and run using java 7.  this task is in direct response to needs expressed by the state of north carolina archives and libraries. everyone in their offices uses windows (either 7 or xp), so this utility needs to be tested on windows.",2,val

DURACLOUD-746,Sync Tool: Add option to not overwrite changed files,"this task is to add an option to the sync tool which ensures that it does not overwrite any existing duracloud content. this means that when a file on the local file system, which has previously been added to duracloud, changes, it is not simply uploaded again.  there are a few choices that need to be made for this new feature to be added: 1. when a file already in duracloud changes on the file system, is the updated file transferred to duracloud or not. if so, the original file will likely need to be renamed to prevent collision. 2. how is the list of updated files communicated to the user. are they printed to the console (stdout), or written to a file? is this consistent between interactive mode and runtocompletion mode? 3. how does this feature impact the upload tool?  a comment from the state of north carolina about how they envision this feature:  ""our ideal upload tool would allow us to specify a local directory to update in the cloud, and the tool would then identify and upload new files (new files defined by file name and path), and alert us to any files that have changed (same file name and path but new checksum hash) and not upload the files that have changed (or upload them in a way that doesn't overwrite the files in the cloud). we would want to make sure that the process of uploading content is kept totally separate from any risk of editing existing content in storage.""",2,val

DURACLOUD-748,Download Multiple Items as a zip or tar archival file.,"this feature sprung into my mind:  it is not driven by user requests, but it seemed that it would be very handy especially once we have a search index for listing content items.   the idea is that it might be useful to be able to download multiple content items in one zip archive.  this would be especially useful if one needed to extract a large number of small files. you could select items either based on a search query or a list of contentids.  i was envisioning it would work both at the durastore as well as duradmin levels.  you would issue a request for an archive and immediately receive a handle.  one could optionally specify an email address. the handle would enable you to get the status of the request.  when the request is complete, if an email address had been specified,  the user would receive an email with a link to the download page.  otherwise the download uri would be available via a status query using the request handle.  once the archive had been downloaded and verified the user could then make a call to remove download site.  if no call was made after a standard expiration time, the download would be removed automatically.  regarding limits: initially the total size limit would be constrained by the available server side disk space.  obviously this is not going to work for extremely large downloads, ie greater than 100 gbs.

DURACLOUD-756,Message consumers disconnecting,"this issue is that for a few different reasons the jms connections which are used to listen to messages from the brokers hosted by durastore/duraservice can disconnect and cease to receive any messages. this has been recorded in the duplicate on change service, as seen in the stack traces in the attached file. this results in the duplicate on change service being rendered essentially useless. this is likely also to be the cause of similar issues where the auditor stops recording changes in the audit log.",1,val

DURACLOUD-758,UI: Check box near space name,"in duradmin, each space name has to its left a checkbox. users expect that selecting the check box will perform the same action as selecting the space name text. instead, selecting the checkbox (of one space or more) brings up a multi select display.  a user from ucar/ncar was recently caught by this issue, and could not understand why the listing of content items was not showing up until they contacted carissa for assistance.  this task is to discover and implement an alternative to the current ui functionality described above which will be more easily understandable.  from carissa: three users within the past month have had the misunderstanding that selecting the checkbox next to a space name would then allow them to view their content. each time i had to field either a support email or call and explain that they should not select the checkbox next to the space name to view the content, add content, edit content, etc. but that they should only click on the name to select/highlight the space to view the content.   ideally either clicking directly on the checkbox or the space name will select the space (add the checkmark) and both actions will behave identically: they will display the content of the space with all the other associated actions. the two actions that we lose by doing this are the ""delete selected space"" and ""edit properties"" on the space level. i believe we should determine another way for those options to appear.",2,val
DURACLOUD-759,Sync Tool: Hidden password option,"this task is to provide an option for the sync tool which will allow users to supply their duracloud password in a way other than via the command line options. the reason this is an issue, is because the full command used to run the sync tool remains available in the process list of the machine on which the sync tool is running.  the suggested fix for this concern is to allow users to define an environment variable which contains their duracloud password, which would be picked up by the sync tool if the  p option is not provided.

DURACLOUD-841,Image gallery viewer,"in a cloud service strategy meeting on aug 6, 2013 (https:/wiki.duraspace.org/display/dspint/20130806cloudservicestrategy) there was a discussion about a need expressed by unc to have a way to view images in duracloud as a gallery, in order to aid in the finding of images in their collection.  i was thinking that this could be accomplished with an html/css/javascript app that is stored in one of the user's spaces, and allows them to select a space (if that's actually necessary, could be hard coded to the one that is their image library) and view a set of images. the javascript would need to make calls to the duracloud rest api to get the list of content items and display each one. the images would likely be scaled down a bit, to make browsing easier, and clicking on them would display the (slightly) larger size. the rest api would also be used to allow paging through the content items (and not trying to display too many at once). the option to specify a prefix for filtering would need to be there, and the user would need to be able to see the full content id of the item they are viewing, since that will be the link back to the full size archival image on their internal system.  there is an expectation that the unc folks will be generating the necessary lowres images that would be viewed through this gallery viewer, and would load those images into a duracloud space.",2,test

DURACLOUD-881,Cannot configure or turn off logging of Retrier in ContentStoreImpl,"the contentstoreimpl currently has hardcoded settings for how it logs errors encountered during ""retries"".  unfortunately, this is not ideal for all use cases of the api.  for example, in the replication task suite, we use contentstoreimpl.getcontentproperties() method as a way to tell whether content already exists in duracloud. if that content does not exist, we expect to receive a notfoundexception. this lets us perform logic like: ""if content exists in duracloud, see what checksum duracloud reports. if duracloud checksum differs from local checksum, reupload the content.""  unfortunately, however, getcontentproperties() logs this same warning message to log4j 4 times in a row (1 + 3 retries) if the content does not yet exist in duracloud:  20140714 16:46:28,336 warn  org.duracloud.client.contentstoreimpl @ error attempting to get properties 'item@1067310.zip' in 'dspacedevbackup' due to: response code was 404, expected value was 200. response body value: null  this causes the logs for the replication task suite to actually fill up with unnecessary warnings from the duracloud v3.1.1 api. for example, anytime we want to upload new content to duracloud, we first check if it already exists (which logs that error x 4) before the new content is uploaded. the logged warnings would cause unnecessary worry for anyone looking at the logs  in reality they are harmless in this scenario, as the content obviously doesn't exist before it is first uploaded.  it looks like the warn message is generated by ""dogetcontentproperties"" here: https:/github.com/duracloud/duracloud/blob/master/storeclient/src/main/java/org/duracloud/client/contentstoreimpl.java#l904  it is then repeated 4 times as a ""log.warn"" in the default execute() method (which is configured to do 3 retries): https:/github.com/duracloud/duracloud/blob/master/storeclient/src/main/java/org/duracloud/client/contentstoreimpl.java#l216  ideally, there should be some way to configure the logging in the contentstoreimpl. i like that this same task is retried 3 times. but in many scenarios, i'd rather it just throw me a final error if all retries failed, rather than logging the same error message multiple times in a row.   if logging cannot be easily configurable, then switching the default execute() method to just do a ""log.debug"" would be better. that way i can see the underlying error if i turn on debugging, but by default my logs don't get filled with the same errors repeated.  note: this was discovered while attempting to upgrade the dspace replication task suite to use duracloud api version 3.1.1 (jars: storeclient, storeprovider, common). unfortunately, until logging is cleaned up in some way, it's unlikely i'll release the upgraded replication task suite code.",2,test

DURACLOUD-942,Add support for S3 - Infrequently Accessed storage option,"according to this announcement: https:/aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/awsstorageupdatenewlowercosts3storageoptionglacierpricereduction/?scichannel=em&scicountry=global&scicampaigntype=launch&scicampaign=em148542750&scidetail=em2049897831&ref=pe430550148542750_7, amazon is now offering the option of a lower cost s3 tier for infrequently accessed data. this task is to transition all duracloud content to this new option.    the best way to take advantage of s3  ia is via bucket lifecycle policies. because of the additional cost of content deletes in the first 30 days, it would be best to set these policies to transition content from s3 standard storage to s3  ia storage after the content has been stored for 30 days. this policy should be created when a new space is created (via the s3storageprovider)    as part of this work, the current s3 task which transitions content to reduced redundancy storage should be replaced with a task that adds the bucket policy for s3  ia to an existing bucket. to complete this transition, a script will need to be written which uses this task to update all current accounts.    the storage class init parameter should also be removed (from both app config, and from the mc). it no longer makes sense to support reduced redundancy storage.",2,test
DURACLOUD-946,Use CloudWatch rather than DuraBoss to generate storage reports,"cloudwatch now provides metrics for s3, providing a daily total of files and total size per bucket in an account. we need to use this rather than running duraboss for reporting, at least on s3 and glacier stores. ideally we can discontinue the use of duraboss completely.",5,test
DURACLOUD-949,Beanstalk: Connect DuraStore to MC database,"in order to have all of the information that is needed, durastore in beanstalk will need to have a direct connection to the mc database. much of the code for setting up this connection should be already available from the mc or mill (share/reuse where possible).    options for getting the database connection information:   as system properties specified in javaopts (using beanstalk environment variables, note that there is a 256 character limit)   use javaopts to point to a config file s3 url, and pull that in on startup.    in order for the durastore calls to complete quickly, and to keep the database load down, information from the db should be cached. this could be done preemptively or lazily, but in either case, there will need to be handling for invalidation, to ensure updates to the database are picked up.",2,test
DURACLOUD-950,Beanstalk: Account determination,"all calls going through durastore will need to determine the account for which the call should be processed. by default this should be done using the subdomain of the host used for the call. there should also be an optional query parameter added to each api call which allows specifying the accountid, as this will be necessary for testing and may be needed by other scenarios.    part of this work will be to ensure that the combination of the account and user credentials still ensures that only users with access to an account are able to make calls that affect that account.",3,test

DURACLOUD-954,Users with USER role should be able to view streams on open spaces,"when a space is set to open streaming (by turning streaming on via duradmin), any user with read access to that space should be able to view media (audio/video) that is streamed through the built in player. currently, this works fine for admin users, but users with only user role just see ""unable to stream file"" where the player should be.    this is very likely to be caused by the fact that a task call is being made to retrieve the streaming url, but that task call is limited to admin users. a user with access to a space should be able to make the task request to stream content from that space.",1,test
DURACLOUD-957,Backup thread runs too frequently on synctool.,currently the synctool's backup thread is running on the same schedule as the directory polling period which is 10 seconds by default.  the back up thread period should not be tied to the polling period.  instead it should run at least every 5 minutes by default.  also thread synchronization on on the changedlist.persist method is causing threads to wait until the backup file is completely written rather than waiting only until the file list is copied in memory.,1,test

DURACLOUD-980,OpenstackProvider marker and prefix params are not url encoded on space listing calls,this problem applies to both get spaces and get spaces chunked calls.  it appears that this problem was addresses for get content calls.  so the openstackstorageprovider performs a url encode as well as some other encoding magic to get things to work properly.   these issues were identified for  jclouds 1.8.0 (the version we're using) in this jira: https:/issues.apache.org/jira/browse/jclouds 217 .  according to the issue details it was resolved in jclouds 2.0.0.   short term solution is to apply the fix to the openstackstorageprovider.  i believe the longer term fix is to upgrade to jclouds 2.0.0.  that later fix will likely be somewhat involved since there were major api changes between 1.x and 2.x.   ,2,test
