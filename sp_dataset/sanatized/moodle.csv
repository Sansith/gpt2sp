MDL-1626,Forum: Per-discussion subscription,"i am finding that my inbox is absolutely flooded with unwanted moodle mails off the forum script. this is very annoying and i know it will similarly annoy my users. in fact it will put them off the system.    the problem arises because unlike other discussion boards moodle messages are emailed to me from the entire forum, not just the thread i have started or responded to. the overwhelming of people's inboxes is a serious business: it could be said that moodle is generating spam because the email feature is so unfocused.    is there any chance this is going to be improved please?",100,train

MDL-10115,A use profile's course list is arbitarily limited with no way of seeing complete list,"when viewing a user's profile, if the list of their courses exceeds 21 (i think) an ellipsis is displayed. this seems a bit useless because... a) you can't click on the ellipsis to see the rest of the courses b) the list isn't even in alphabetic order so it becomes even more arbitrary c) the ellipsis is easy to miss, so you may not realise the list is truncated  suggest either making this work properly, i.e., the ellipsis is clickable or if the list is not considered important just put ""too many courses to show"" if it exceeds a certain amount. it would seem sensible to display them in alphabetic order too.  without this it is difficult for an administrator to see all the courses a user is in if (for example) checking role assignments.",13,train

MDL-13114,Include bulk course create and remove with Moodle through the use of CSV files,"we're looking to moodle for a replacement to blackboard enterprise.  in order for moodle to be a viable replacement we need a way to bulk create and delete courses based on csv files.  the bulk create courses is handled by use of a 3rd party module (uploadcourse.php created by rory allford).  however once we import say 700+ courses there's no way to them bulk remove them at the end of a semester (removing 1 by 1 would be too time consuming).  we would really prefer that this functionality be included within moodle, as relying on 3rd party modules (no matter how good they are), inherits a risk if the module stops getting updated.",100,train

MDL-18770,Non-graded Assignment and Quizzes appear in the gradebook  and have Max Grade assigned,"nongraded assignment and quizzes are getting displayed in the gradebook, and they look like being included into aggregation in the cat&items interface, since they have max grade value set to 100.  other activities behave definitely. e.g. if forum is not graded, it does not appear in the gradebook as a column. which for me is an expected behavior.    1. add an assignment. set it to no grade. column will still appear in the gradebook. now go to the cat&items interface. it will display max grade for that column to be 100 points. (though it will not be actually included into the calculation)  2. add an assignment. set it to be graded on a scale (scales are not included in aggregation for us). maximum grade in the cat&items interface will display some number (e.g. 3, if there are 3 items in a scale). it is confusing, since one would now expect that 3 to be calculated toward course/category total.  3. add a quiz, add some questions, and make the quiz to be worth 0 points. maximum grade in the cat&items interface will still be 10 points (or 100). interestingly enough, i can manually delete a gradebook column for this kind of quiz.

MDL-31410,PayPal IPN Script exposed to message_send() failure,"the below issue includes the resolution. it merely needs to be marked as fixed and merged in to the main development branch.    the ipn.php script, that is a part of the paypal enrolment method, makes calls to a function ""messagesend"" that can cause the entire paypal enrolment method to fail.    the ipn script is called by paypal when a payment has been processed. paypal calls the script and passes various tokens regarding the transaction. the ipn script:    1) opens a handle for the paypal connection  2) evaluates the received tokens and validates them  3) enrols a student accordingly  4) notifies the student, instructors & admins via a call to ""messagesend()""  5) closes the connection from paypal    various people have been reporting that their paypal enrolments work fine for a while, but they start getting these ipn failure warning messages from paypal. in their ipn history in paypal, they see a list of failed transactions where the server (moodle) response was a 404.    what's happening for these people, is the 4th step above is failing. the ipn script dies as a product of messagesend() failing and the php server process would seem to time out and cause the web server to return a 404 to paypal. since step 3 has been completed, end users of moodle are getting what they need from the plugin. however paypal doesn't tolerate the 404 responses for long and automatically disables ipn messaging after a while  causing paypal enrolments to fail entirely.    the solution i'm proposing is really simple. i've modified ipn.php to use a wrapper function for messagesend that puts the call in trycatch block. this insulates the execution of ipn.php from whatever messagesend failures ruining the whole experience. i believe resolving the issue in messagesend is another matter (and may merely be a misconfiguration thing   though myself and others do have systems that send us emails successfully, guess those situations aren't depending on the same function).    i've attached my modified version of ipn.php below. i hope it is immediately merged in to the main development branch as this is probably affecting even more people than have been complaining about it.    this issue has been observed by me personally across a wide range of 2.x moodle installations. i've avoided fixing it myself and have just run on weekly builds hoping someone else would fix it. but push came to shove thus i fixed it myself.",3,train

MDL-31776,"Additional name fields, to allow Asian languages to flexibly display user names in Chinese characters, local phonetic system or Romanization","alternate name fields  this is a proposal on behalf of the moodle association of japan (http:/moodlejapan.org). we are willing to work closely with moodle hq on this improvement and help by providing some funding for its development.  the standard moodle has only two fields for names ""firstname"" and ""lastname"". in countries that use a different writing system, this means that two sets of names need to be displayed, their name in the local writing system and their name in romanization. moodle needs a way to input both types of names, and for both the individual and the administrator (and perhaps at the course level) to determine which names appear in the various moodle contexts.   an ideal configuration  i propose three additional fields: surnamephon givenphon alternatename   for standard english and european usage, these would be ignored, but for japanese, chinese, korean and perhaps other writing systems such as thai, the various indian languages and arabic. possible entries would look like this:    lastnamelastphonalternate 佐藤サトウsatou hiroshikorean奎報규보 陳ㄔㄣchen meihua|   the site administrator would select how the $fullname variable would appear. for japanese, for example, the administrator might select lastname  firstname  alternate so that the students' names would appear in kanji, but with the romanization of it following the kanji.  this would allow everyone to know how the name should be pronounced.  (even japanese need this since there are alternate pronunciations for kanji. ""神部"" for example, could be read as ""kamibe"" or ""kambe"" depending on the preference of the user's family.)   any combination of the above could also be selected as the default for user names that appear in various tables.  if the selected fields for tables is one of the asian phonetic fields, then rather than the standard alphabet display for filtering the list by first name and last name, a similar selection display would appear for the selected alphabetic system.  for chinese, a selection would also need to be made for the phonetic system to use.  taiwan uses the ""bopomofo"" (zhuyin) system, while mainland china uses the pinyin system.  student id display  for many asian languages, another problem not encountered so much in the west is people with identical names. this, plus the fact that some of the languages (namely japanese and chinese) have no convenient method for ordering names in chinese characters, means that most schools rely on the student id for ordering and identifying students rather than (or in addition to) their names.  thus, there should also be an option in the site setup selecting the studentid field to be displayed to the left of names on various listings such as the grade book, assignment evaluation, etc.  complexity & coding time:  this problem is quite complex since it involves modifying core code in perhaps 50100 files that do database i/o, table displays, preference selections, etc. and would need to be done in close coordination with moodle headquarters.  who would benefit from this improvement?: probably every institution in asia that has staff who do not read the local language need to be able to display names in both the local language and roman letters. various, rather unsatisfactory ad hoc solutions are currently used but a permanent, more elegant solution is urgently needed.

MDL-34744,MSSQL backup fails under some circumstances,"we encountered the problem when our automated backups weren't running properly; they'd get stuck part way through. trying to backup the courses the auto backup got stuck at gave us the same problem.    certain  big courses (in the sense of lots of resources, not filesize) don't backup up properly either manually or through the automated system. the backup process just ran until it gets a fastcgi error. we tried to see if we could narrow it down to particular types of resources, but that wasn't it. as an example, one course which wouldn't backup had a category level question bank with 1000+ questions.    i did a lot of unsuccessful troubleshooting, which i've not reported here's where we're at now, hopefully it's useful to someone. please note that the changes i detail below are not a fix, they were done for troubleshooting, using them in production introduces other problems:    tracing the backup process we found the problem would always occur in the   backupstructuredbops.class.php file     in the     function moveannotationstofinal($backupid, $itemname)     within the     $db>setfield('backupidstemp', 'itemname', $itemname . 'final', array('id' => $annotation>id));     call.    adding traces here shows it ticking along fine but then just stopping. multiple attempts to backup the same course (after waiting for cron to clear out temp stuff) ended up failing at the same point.    tracing deeper into the setfield function, it calls the sqlsrv doquery,     to troubleshoot, i added a query timeout as follows (none was specified originally)  in sqlsrvnativemoodledatabase function doquery   $result = sqlsrvquery($this>sqlsrv, $sql,array(),array('querytimeout'=>10));    the backups now return with error  debug info: sqlstate: hyt00/  error code: 0/  message: [microsoft][sql server native client 10.0]query timeout expired/  update #mdlbackupidstemp set itemname = n'filefinal' where id = '1366'  [array (  0 => 'filefinal',  1 => '1366',  )]  stack trace:  •line 397 of \lib\dml\moodledatabase.php: dmlwriteexception thrown  •line 252 of \lib\dml\sqlsrvnativemoodledatabase.php: call to moodledatabase>queryend()  •line 370 of \lib\dml\sqlsrvnativemoodledatabase.php: call to sqlsrvnativemoodledatabase>queryend()  •line 1098 of \lib\dml\sqlsrvnativemoodledatabase.php: call to sqlsrvnativemoodledatabase>doquery()  •line 1475 of \lib\dml\moodledatabase.php: call to sqlsrvnativemoodledatabase>setfieldselect()  •line 146 of \backup\util\dbops\backupstructuredbops.class.php: call to moodledatabase>setfield()  •line 1338 of \backup\moodle2\backupstepslib.php: call to backupstructuredbops::moveannotationstofinal()  •line 34 of \backup\util\plan\backupexecutionstep.class.php: call to moveinfo  refannotationstofinal>defineexecution()  •line 153 of \backup\util\plan\basetask.class.php: call to backupexecutionstep>execute()  •line 148 of \backup\util\plan\baseplan.class.php: call to basetask>execute()  •line 105 of \backup\util\plan\backupplan.class.php: call to baseplan>execute()  •line 296 of \backup\controller\backupcontroller.class.php: call to backupplan>execute()  •line 111 of \backup\util\ui\backupui.class.php: call to backupcontroller>executeplan()  •line 89 of \backup\backup.php: call to backupui>execute()    varying the timeout had no effect; it failed at the same place, just would take longer...  so adding the timeout here gets the backup process to fail after the timeout (rather than waiting for a fastcgi timeout). it looks like mssql just not responding.    i wanted to see what was happening with the tables, which is hard for mssql and temp tables, since they're session based. i don't have access to the moodle db sessions' temp tables from my db admin tool.    to get around this, i modified \backup\util\dbops\backupcontrollerdbopsclass.php (around line 141&150), so that a real table was created/deleted, instead of using mssqls session based temp tables (just removed ""temp"" in the calls to dbman, ie   $dbman>createtemptable($xmldbtable); becomes  $dbman>createtable($xmldbtable);   and around 150   $dbman>droptemptable($table); becomes  $dbman>droptable($table);    there's a similar fix neccessary in   \backup\util\dbops\restorecontrollerdbopsclass.php, line 109,     with this change, the backup and restore work ok.     my hypothesis is that at some point during the long backup, another connection gets made to mssql; since temp tables are associated with connections, the link to the original temp table gets lost and the data isn't available. of course this doesn't explain why the sqlsrv call ust times out rather than returning an error.    we've actually been using the system with this little change, but it's not really satisfactory  the problem, of course, is that only one backup/restore can be run on the system at any one time because there's just the one temp table; and multiple backups just conflict, requiring the temp table we created to be dropped.      some related posts  http:/moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=177822 (i posted this early)    possibly related http:/tracker.moodle.org/browse/mdl28162 other commenters on this issue were on mssql    ",40,train

MDL-38228,"Major Performance Problem with ""Moving Modules"" upgrade step","the upgrade script portion of the fix for mdl 37939 is inefficient and causes a considerable performance problem for upgrading large sites.  the process queries course modules for each course section individually.  that's a pretty big deal for moodlerooms, where our largest site has nearly 445,000 course sections, and an average of over 6,000 course sections across 1,200 sites.    the root of the problem is finding the course modules which don't exist in the sequence field of the related course section.  the following query will get those course section records for you.      select cs.  from mdlcoursesections cs  inner join mdlcoursemodules cm    on (cm.course = cs.course and cm.section = cs.id)  where concat(',', cs.sequence, ',') not like concat('%,', cm.id, ',%')      the following returns an average of 33 course sections for affected sites (~80%), with a maximum of 772 course sections.    note: findinset is an operator that only works for mysql and pg, but the query can be tweaked to support any rdbms.    additonally:  for 2.5 and 2.6 branches the new upgrade script has to be run again because of another bug. in version 2.4 we can just replace the old script with a faster one.",20,train

MDL-38561,Convert filepickers and filemanagers to YUI modules,"these are a little broken, as discussed in mdl38515.    corefilepicker describes a file in /repository/filepicker.js which adds a yui module called moodlecorefilepicker.    because the yui module is wrapped in a yui.add line, it's contents are only added to the sandbox when a module depends on moodlecorefilepicker.    so in order to get this to work, corefilepicker depends on moodlecorefilepicker.  the inclusion of corefilepicker means that the js file itself is included, and then the contents of it's yui module are handled by our legacy code having it depend on it's own module.    this is really really broken and needs to be fixed as it prevents us from detecting and reporting other issues.    my suggested fix is to go over the existing code and convert all of the bits to appropriate yui modules.    this may give us an opportunity to write a treeview based on the new yui3 y.tree so we can remove the current dependence on yui2 here.    my guess is that this could be a week or two's work.",100,train

MDL-42834,Deprecate loginhttps,"in my opinion, it's about time we deprecated and removed the loginhttps config setting and sealed this potential leak.    it was removed from mahara over three years ago (https:/bugs.launchpad.net/mahara/+bug/646713) for two primary reasons:   it broke ajax login; and   there can be times where an http link is present on an https page.    in moodle we don't have ajax login, and we have mitigated against the https > http issue by always setting the wwwroot to the current schema.    however, it would be really super nice if we could have ajax login, and i don't feel that the reasons which once prevented forced use of https throughout a site are as strong as they used to be. hardware performance is far better than it was five years ago; it's been http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/firesheep so these things are no longer theoretical or even hard; and ssl is far more widespread.    as it is, we already load all additional content (e.g. css, js, image) over ssl so it's now just the actual page content which is not.    we no longer have issues with third party plugins not supporting ssl (e.g. youtube, vimeo, etc).    i'd like to propose that we drop support for loginhttps.

MDL-44002,Decide upon intended screen reader support,"each of the screen readers we've come across seem to do things their way, and have differing levels of support for:   different accessibility features;   browsers; and   operating systems    we need to determine which screen reader(s) we intend to make moodle work best with in order to choose the most optimal solution for these readers.    our selection also has a big impact upon the amount of time it requires to develop new functionality and changes, and to test it.    from the compatibility matrix i've created so far (http:/goo.gl/b4cvb5), there are approximately 30 combinations of screen reader  browser  operating system available to users.    considerations    ideally, this should be as few combinations as possible because as we add each combination, the complexity increases dramatically, as does the time required for development and testing.    the ideal solution would be for a single, well documented, well tested, and widely available screenreader, but as http:/goo.gl/b4cvb5 shows, this will not be possible as no screen reader supports both windows, macintosh, and linux whilst providing support for multiple browsers.    whilst mobile support would be desirable, i think initially we should focus on improving the support for desktop screen readers as a priority and look at adding mobile combinations later.    options    data suggests that the most widely used primary reader by far is jaws [1] though it's usage has seen rapid decline over the past few years.    jaws is followed in popularity by windowseyes, and apple's voiceover.    chromevox is the only screen reader we've come across to support the same browser across multiple operating systems which may also be an important consideration for some users. at present its market share is low (0.2% [1]) but it is new to the arena  from what i can tell it was only released in february 2012 [2] with the survey taking place in may 2012.    nvda, which came in at fourth place in the webaim survey is also an interesting option as it is the highest ranked free solution for windows, though it is only compatible with windows and the firefox + ie browsers.    recommendations    to offer the most widespread selection it makes sense to choose from the following subset of screen readers.    i have not, at this stage, commented on the ease of development for each screen reader at present, or it's comparative support for various accessiblity functionality.    jaws  pros:   high market penetration    cons:   cost to users   windows only   internet explorer only    nvda  pros:   free   midlevel market penetration    cons:   windows only   firefox and internet explorer only    os x voiceover  pros:   free   supports all browsers tested   also available on ios    cons:   mac os only    chromevox  pros:   free   crossoperating system    cons:   google chrome only      sources:  [1] http:/webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey4/  [2] https:/code.google.com/p/googleaxschrome/source/browse/trunk/chromevox/readme?r=143",40,val

MDL-45893,Developing a User Menu,"adding a user menu, in the bootstrapbase themes; refer to the specification to know what it should contain, and how to implement it.    the general approach here is to refactor the existing navbar's capabilities, allowing it to support multiple dropdowns without adversely affecting existing dom structure (which would necessitate every theme retargeting its styles).    update 10/06/2014: the user menu is being rendered fine, but the current solution doesn't quite encapsulate everything that'll need to happen with the navbar; in particular, pageheadingmenu() stuff isn't handled by this solution as it doesn't really make sense for that stuff to live in a dropdown.    update 24/06/2014: okay, this turned out to be huge.     the new usermenu renderable is an extension of the custommenu renderable, constructed with references to a user, a course, a page and an array of flags (at present, the only thing that makes sense to set a priori is guest, a boolean flag).   basing the new renderable on the custommenu allows for it to be easily displayed in basebased themes as well.   a minor bug in custommenu's yui3 dropdown code was fixed: in brief, the logic was looking for a dropdown attribute on the node that was clicked (e.target) instead of the node that the event was actually wired to (e.currenttarget).   custommenu renderables have been extended by way of mdl46022 and have also gained the ability to assign css suffix flags to custommenuitems  which is necessary for us to avoid having to hardcode icons into the renderer php.   in order to support multiple collapsible menus, it was necessary to create an entire bootstrapnavbar renderable which renders the body > header element and renders out a collection of menus. bootstrap javascript has been patched to allow for multiple navbar items.   responsive styles have been provided.",100,val

MDL-54751,Recycle Bin - deleting large complex objects forces user to wait,"with the recycle bin enabled, deleting large, complex objects forces the user to wait until the backup process has completed before they can do anything else. when you delete small objects (e.g., labels, simple pages), the deletion occurs quickly. by ""deletion,"" i mean this workflow:    1.  turn editing on  2.  delete item  3.  turn editing off    but when you delete a larger, complex object, step 3 above  turning editing off  can take a long time ( up to > 2 minutes), and there is no indication (other than what the browser provides) that something is happening. you basically have to wait for it to finish. something that used to happen immediately  turning editing off after deleting something (regardless of its complexity)  can take minutes with the recycle bin enabled. an example of a ""large, complex object"" is a quiz with 95 questions and 155 student responses. obviously, moodle is working on backing up the quiz, and since it's rather complex (lots of responses), it takes time. the same thing happens on restore. restoring this kind of quiz can take some time, but there isn't any kind of progress indicator to let the user know that something is happening and that it may take some time.    the concern here is that with the recycle bin enabled, a fundamental aspect of the moodle experience has changed; i.e., deleting some objects no longer happens quickly if they are complex. how long it takes for moodle to return control when turning editing back off after deleting an object depends on how large/complex that object is. and moodle provides no progress indicator that something is happening.    we also saw this behavior when testing the recycle bin plugin our moodle 2.7 site (we also saw session lock errors for large object deletions). we also see this issue on a test moodle 3.1 server with the recycle bin enabled. while this quiz example may represent an outlier, users delete all sort of things... small and large objects.",5,test

MDL-54847,HTML audio tag removed from forum post,"a user wishes to embed a .wav file into a forum post.  adding the .wav file via the text editor's media button only inserts a hyperlink to the file (see mdl54846).  using the text editor's source mode, the user attempts to embed the uploaded .wav file using the html 5 audio tag.  however, upon saving, the audio tag is automatically removed so the file is not embedded.  using the same code in a page resource, the audio tag is not removed.     steps to replicate       1. create a forum activity.   2. add a new post to the forum.   3. click the media button on the text editor.   4. upload a .wav file and then click the insert media button.  the .wav file is added to the page as a hyperlink.   5. click the html button on the text editor to switch into source mode.   6. update the html using the html 5 audio tag to embed the .wav file into the page.  same code:    /the wav file should be embedded./  /  /  your browser does not support the audio element.  /     7. submit the post.   8. read the post.  also edit the post and click the html button on the text editor.     observed behavior:   the .wav file is not embedded in the html.  the audio tag has been removed.  the resulting html:    /the wav file should be embedded./your browser does not support the audio element.       expected behavior:   the audio tag is retained in the html.  the .wav file is embedded into the forum post allowing the audio file to be played directly from the post.     replication locations   behavior has been replicated in 3.0.4 and 2.9.3.    additional investigation notes    1. the audio tag is removed from the forum post html regardless of the file type being embedded.  for example, attempting to embed an .mp3 file with the audio tag also results in the audio tag being removed.   2. behavior was replicated with both the atto and tinymce text editors.     user impact   an instructor teaching a sound design course would like for students to be able to share their .wav files within forums.  the .wav file format is not among the file formats currently handled by moodle's media embedding features (see mdl54846).  a potential work around would be manually entered the necessary html to embed the file, but this cannot be done when the audio tag is automatically removed.",3,test
