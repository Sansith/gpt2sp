STUDIO-618, Namespaces in the XML view are not being removed when you remove all the elements of a kind,"when you add an element and then you remove it, the reference to the schema file is not being removed from the xml namespaces.      steps to reproduce:   1. create a project in studio with a flow in it and go to the global elements tab.   2. add for example a global jetty endpoint with the default values.   3. go to the xml view and check that the xml code for the endpoint is there with reference to the mulejetty.xsd in the namespaces  4. go back to the global elements tab and delete the endpoint.     issue: now if you go back to the xml view, the code for the endpoint is not there as ti should but the reference to the mulejetty.xsd is still there and it shouldn't as there is no jetty element in the flow or in the global elements tab.     be very careful when implementing this as the reference in the namespaces should be remve if there is no other instance of the element kind in a flow or as a global element such as a global endpoint or connector, but if there is no reference to an element kind (ex: some jetty element) there is no reason for the namespace to be there.

STUDIO-2655,Lossing enpoint reference to a global endpoint across different flow files,"how to re crecreate:   (1) create global endpoints (i.e. file:endpoint)in a dedicated flow file to store all global components.

(4) using the graphical editor(message flow tab) to edit the display name of each node.  at this point all the references will be removed, the flow will be broken.     the explanation:     we are trying to introduce the test driven development using the functionaltest.    for this, we need to put all the endpoints together with their connectors to a separate dedicated flow file. then in the src/test/resources, we create a test flow file that contains the corresponding endpoints (with the same name) that will replace the real endpoints in the functional test.   however, the mulestudio fail to recognise the global endpoints ferenced from across the separate flow file. even worse, it keeps removing them while it is perfectlu legal in terms of mule.    suggestion of fix:     option 1:    able to recognise the global endpoints across different flow files    option 2:   just ignore the attributes and values it does not understand and put a warning sign instead of removing them. this may be preferable since mulestudio may not understand all the added feature of the mule components...   for example, messagepropertiestransformer has the scope attribute, this will be removed by the mulestudio because it does not understand it.    also it will be nice not to try to create mflow files for the files in src/test/resources, so that it will not complain about the uniqueue reference etc.... i know this should be another jira ticket :)                  ",5,train
