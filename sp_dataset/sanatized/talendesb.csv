TESB-3824,Make sure RouteBuilder class is exposed when route is exported as OSGi bundle,"the wrapper code is a critical piece of code which links us from the studio environment, to the vanilla eclipse environment, to the runtime environment and it badly needs refactoring.  the runtime environment is unnecessarily limited to just osgi through the osgi bundle dependency.  this and other dependencies should be separated from the core routebuilder code.    the route builder is so embedded inside (imo) unnecessarily nested classes that the generated route cannot be accessed cleanly or used for anything other than launching in an overly restricted way (whether as osgi or talend job makes little difference).      fortunately, i think it can be effectively accessed for integration testing.  if not, the ci process is disrupted not just by tooling but by the fundamental design of the generated code.    i think we can currently still extract just the route from external code that calls route(false) so that the camelcontext is not started.  right now the routebuilder created by initroute is already attached to the camelcontext.  in a unit test environment with cameltest i think we can set the test context to the generated camelcontext, and use the route function to supply the configure method.  i will verify this.    but this should not have to be verified.  a peace of code this critical should be crystal clear.  even with the code generator's impact, the code should be much better.  much of the code can be moved into a non generated framework class which is simply switched using a strategy pattern by the studio via generated code.    ps: why is the method route capitalized?

TESB-4116,Multiple Redundant Connection Factories and Components Registered in Camel Context,"code generated by esb studio seem to generate multiple redundant component registrations and also redundant connections factories.  for example, suppose multiple activemq endpoints are referenced in route.  they all refer to the same activemq connection, but they refer to different destination topics and routes.    in 5.0m4 this was the code that was generated.  i have to confirm that this is still the case in rc3.    note that each component is registered with the camelcontext, i.e. cactivemq1 is a camel component that is used exactly once.  likewise, a separate connection factory is created each time.        camelcontext.addcomponent(""cactivemq1"",        org.apache.activemq.camel.component.activemqcomponent          .jmscomponent(amqconnectionfactory));      amqconnectionfactory = new org.apache.activemq.activemqconnectionfactory(        ""tcp:/localhost:61616"");      camelcontext.addcomponent(""cactivemq7"",        org.apache.activemq.camel.component.activemqcomponent          .jmscomponent(amqconnectionfactory));      amqconnectionfactory = new org.apache.activemq.activemqconnectionfactory(        ""tcp:/localhost:61616"");      camelcontext.addcomponent(""cactivemq2"",        org.apache.activemq.camel.component.activemqcomponent          .jmscomponent(amqconnectionfactory));      amqconnectionfactory = new org.apache.activemq.activemqconnectionfactory(        ""tcp:/localhost:61616"");      camelcontext.addcomponent(""cactivemq4"",        org.apache.activemq.camel.component.activemqcomponent          .jmscomponent(amqconnectionfactory));      amqconnectionfactory = new org.apache.activemq.activemqconnectionfactory(        ""tcp:/localhost:61616"");      camelcontext.addcomponent(""cactivemq6"",        org.apache.activemq.camel.component.activemqcomponent          .jmscomponent(amqconnectionfactory));      amqconnectionfactory = new org.apache.activemq.activemqconnectionfactory(        ""tcp:/localhost:61616"");      camelcontext.addcomponent(""cactivemq9"",        org.apache.activemq.camel.component.activemqcomponent          .jmscomponent(amqconnectionfactory));    one approach is to manage context scope resources such as components via tabs within the cconfig component.  things like the activemq connection and the formal camel activemq component  (i.e. endpoint factory) should be named properties that can then be referenced by actual activemq endpoint instances in much the same way sqlendpoints reference a shared db connection. but these shouldnot_ be global variables accessed via the studio context.  they should be attached to the camel context.

either the code is not been executed  or there is any security mechanism in karaf disabling the possibility to set these properties programatically. i don't know.    as the path to the keystore file has not been set, the system uses the default java truststore. based on this the handshake with the correctly configured provider using karaf https configuration fails, as the required certificate cannot be found in the default truststore on consumer side. a corresponding handshake exception is also visible on provider side:      javax.net.ssl.sslhandshakeexception: received fatal alert: certificateunknown      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.alerts.getsslexception(alerts.java:174)[:1.6      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.alerts.getsslexception(alerts.java:136)[:1.6]      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.sslsocketimpl.recvalert(sslsocketimpl.java:1806)[:1.6]      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.sslsocketimpl.readrecord(sslsocketimpl.java:986)[:1.6]      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.sslsocketimpl.performinitialhandshake(sslsocketimpl.java:1170)[:1.6]      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.sslsocketimpl.starthandshake(sslsocketimpl.java:1197)[:1.6]      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.sslsocketimpl.starthandshake(sslsocketimpl.java:1181)[:1.6]      at org.eclipse.jetty.server.ssl.sslsocketconnector$sslconnectorendpoint.run(sslsocketconnector.java:659)[59:org.eclipse.jetty.server:7.4.5.v20110725]      at org.eclipse.jetty.util.thread.queuedthreadpool$3.run(queuedthreadpool.java:529)[53:org.eclipse.jetty.util:7.4.5.v20110725]      at java.lang.thread.run(thread.java:680)[:1.6.029]      as a workaround i've set the same properties (javax.net.ssl.truststore and javax.net.ssl.truststorepassword) with the same configuration (path and password) as ""d"" parameter in the tesb start script ""trun"" and have executed the same consumer job feature once again. the result was a successful requestresponse message exchange in this case.       i think the proper and better approach for https configuration on consumer side with cxf is to create / generate a corresponding xml htmlconduit configuration using spring/blueprint. as additional advantage this approach would also enable a setting which is not available with the normal java ssl configuration: disabling the host verification  which is a very helpful_ feature for many usages and is been implemented by all containers (including karaf)  except pure old java itself. :) such a solution would enable us to add a corresponding check box in the component. with the current approach (setting the ssl properties) such a feature is not available.    please note that using tsetkeystore component instead of directly configuring ssl within the tesbconsumer component does not fix the problem as the approach of the generated code is the same.    => find attached the exported consumer job as example.      /  the settings for trust store and password are only meant for the stand alone case. it's anyway not the job of the job /route / service designer to specify the location of the trust store in the container. this is the responsibility of an admin. we should rather provide a way to specify these properties container wide and use them for all data service clients. these properties are:   wsdl port name for which the configuration is valid   location of the trust store and corresponding password   location of the key store and corresponding password   alias for the certificate    host verification on / off  of course it should be possible to specify configuration for several ports.    as usual part of this item is to add documentation for this feature.    /",3,train

TESB-4539,Modify cBean To Register Beans with Container,"cbean only creates anonymous beans based on a class rather than objects.  these anonymous beans cannot be configured using constructors.  as a result the user is forced to configure them with code rather than gui.    in addition, there is no singleton object, so references to the bean  different routes end up created different bean instances which are unaware of each other.  even in the cconfig section because there is no means of getting a handle to them.    as a result the user is left writing java code without a real object based component framework.  it is important that our code generator generates code which uses a solid component framework rather than building from the ground up.  while the user or us could reinvent the wheel, it is important that our components build and extend existing frameworks correctly.    the camel context registry interface is can lookup beans, but the bean id is required.  the camel registry does not serve to register beans.  so the best solution would be to inject an abstraction of the container that allows registration of beans.      these beans should be fairly general so their properties can be configured by the user without writing code.  an important ability is for beans to refer to other beans via their properties.    like the cconfig bean they are not directly connected to routes.  instead, they are connected to routes via the cbean with a ref property.  like cconfig, and unlike the eip oriented elements, the beans are referenced by the flow rather than participating directly in the wiring.  so it may make sense to have another resource or bean tab perspective (like the code or design tabs) that shows the wiring of these static resources.  this keeps separation of concerns between resource structure and message flow.",3,train

TESB-4998,Runtime Update PoC,"in a first feature we investigated what the specific problems we encounter with update management in an osgi environment and what the possible solutions are. this feature goes one step further where its goal is to make a poc to provide a rudimentary update framework. it is assumed that the  new version does not override the old one but is installed beside the old one. so the goal of the updte framework is to take over user defined features / bundles / configurations and tesb runtime configuration that was changed by the user, e.g port. also it can be assumed that all user defined artifacts are still accessible and can be retrieved to be installed in the new container. normallythey will reside in archiva or some other maven repository.    basic idea is to have one component in the old container which retrieves a list of all feature repositories together with the url from which they were installed, and the list of all installed features. from these two lists the repositories and features that natively come with tesb runtime are removed. another component in the new container is then responsible to take the list and make all feature repositories known in the container and to install all the features specified in the list.    for the configuration we either copy the whole ./etc directory from the old container to the new one and set the properties new for the current version via config admin or retrieve via config admin a list of all properties of the old container and apply it to the new conatiner. make sure there is no conflict with configuration set when the usser defined features are installed.    important is to validate the approach is feasable not to automate everything and to have a polished tooling.

TESB-6710,When adding the sam feature to the cxf bus instead of a single endpoint the monitoring service call is logged and goes into recursion,"normally the evenfeature is added into the endpoint or client. in some cases it makes sense to simply add the feature to the cxf bus. for example when using the camel from(""cxf:address"") there is no endpoint bean to add the sam feature to.     so you add the evenfeature into  /  /  /    in this case every service call triggers the monitoring service call. then the monitoring service call triggers the monitoring which triggers the monitoring ....    so a simple solution would be to filter out all service calls that originate from the monitoring service. this would make the above case simpler and even allow to offer the monitoring feature as a osgi service to enable it for all cxf services in a tesb runtime.",2,train

TESB-8084,Expose BPM Process as REST Service,"as a process designer in talend studio i would like to expose my business process as esb rest service on talend esb.    we need to reuse 'create bpm service' wizard we implemented for data services.  on page 'select bpm process' we need to add radio buttons:   soap service   rest service    for 'soap service'  visible configuration for generating data services (as is now)  for 'rest service'  configuration for create rest service:   rest endpoint (default is ""/services/"")    in result wizard will generate (just a proposal):   rest job (trestrequest > txmlmap1 > tbonitainstansiateprocess > txmlmap2 > trestresponse) which start bpm process   trestrequest should be configured for one post operation: uri == '/'   trestrequest should accept xml payload with parameters that should resemble process data (exactly the same for data services)    rest service produced by wizard should work from studio and deployed in runtime.",3,val
TESB-8090,Adapt all clients of XACML registry to use only the ATOM based service.,"adapt all clients of xacml registry to use only the atom based service. currently atom is only used for collection retrieval, not for single policy retrieval and for the initial test upload. adapt pdp, initial policy upload and all test cases accordingly. main motivation is to remove the need to install both the atom rest and the (pure) rest feature in order to use xacml registry.",3,val

TESB-8109,Provide a means to check consistency and quality of the Service Registry documents,"as maintainer of the sr artifacts i want to ensure the artifacts have a certain level of quality so that lookup results are usable at runtime.     artifacts uploaded to the registry are by default valid. still this is not sufficient to ensure data is usable, e.g. references to other artifacts may not be resolvable or artifacts might be inconsistent.    as the requirements of different service registry users may vary the checker should be extensible via plugins. the scope of this feature is to provide the framework for the checker, one plugin which recursevly checks that all references in a registry document are resolvable, and documentation how to write and integrate further plugins.    part of the framework is also to specify a response format to provide the report of a check execution.    check of a specific service registry should be exposed as a resource, which only accepts get and returns the corresponding report. the uri of the ""check"" resource must be included as a / element in the atompub entry of the corresponding registry document. also define a meaningful link relation type as part of the link element.

TESB-11187,EventLogging: Improve database structure of Event Logging SQL database,"just like the sam database structure the event logging structure is far away from being optimal.  considering the possibly large number of records the may end up inside the sql tables esp. the primary keys / index definitions should be reconsidered.  note that this discussion is based on the default ddl (create.sql / createind.sql  appears to be for derby).     using a uuid as primary key appears to be a not extremely good idea.   while it can be argued that by definition the uuid is pretty unique, it still doe not not come with a guarantee to be (http:/tinyurl.com/6z94fcv ). apart from the fact that the low probability does not say anything about when the algorithm will produce a duplicate  it just how often duplicates statistically arise number of calls. ( black swans do exist  even though statistically they appear to be nonexistent ;) )   when considering that the ddl creates the id field (regardless of whether is should be a primary key or not!) as a id varchar(255) not null, one should note that for today's 128 bit uuids a field length of 36 characters would be sufficient. note that databases  on the physical page level  are rather unhappy with variable length keys. with fixed length keys there are much more efficient when maintaining index / table spaces  esp. finding out, on which physical page a record / index entry can be found.   from perspective of the application, it can be fine to have this uuid as a column (if sized correctly), but it should not be a primary key, because  even with the length shortened as explained above, it will unnecessarily blow up the index space of the database. instead, a serial (incrementable) number (like in sam db) would be a much better choice, because   unique key generation can be made safely inside a database transaction and will be extremely cheap  esp. when considering that with batch inserts the software could obtain the keys for all records in the insert batch with one minimal operation (e.g. when having to insert 20 records we just need to increment the sequence field by 20 once, close the transaction, assign the keys and insert our batch while in parallel another request would be save to allocate new ids for the batch of records it tries to insert  so even multiple event logging server processes could work efficiently in parallel using the same database).   it takes much less space (and we are talking about a database where we have to expect large amounts of records) in the primary table eventlog and the secondary table eventlogcustominfo   while we do not have a strict sequence order in all case, the records are still pretty much in sequence order  which could simplify garbage collection (recurring clean up of tables which is put on the customer's shoulders for now ...) and increase the chance of database internal cache hits when sequentially processing records.     creating primary keys for secondary table eventlogcustominfo is unnecessarily inefficient (see also tesb9724 !).    we should not require a sequence field here! instead we should use a fixed length composite key of eventid (assuming that it's ""just"" a number) and a short local sequence number we can generate on the fly when inserting the custom properties (as we know how many custom properties come with the event record we just assign numbers from 1../ ).    consequently the sub id field does not have to be long (we save space on the primary index). using this composite key will also increase the probability that the database stores the dependent records for the custom info physically in the same or a nearby located database segment  so the chances of a database cache hit is increased.   with that kind of primary key, there's no need to add and maintain the additional index needed for joining eventlog and eventlog_custominfo  records   which again saves database space and provides more performance.    so, please, please, remove this technical dept from event logging. for sam it's already much harder than here, because sam is already out with the customers and any schema change would require a data migration for customer data. with event logging we could avoid this from the start.",2,test

TESB-12363,Backport-5.3.2 - Hyperic - issue with dynamic bus.id to map Services after Talend Runtime restart,the bus.id gets a different id each time a service is (re )started. this currently cause issues with the hyperic monitoring as the admin needs to manually update the bus.id each time a talend runtime is restarted (which is not feasible)    as a result of this missmatch the service will be shown as not avaiblable (red icon) and no metric data will be updated.,2,test
