TIMOB-7249,"Android: Intent - getData(), getAction(), and getType() do not work","problem    when deciding how an app should handle an incoming android intent, knowing the type, action, and data values that were sent with the intent are critical. if your app only handles one very specific intent, this is ok, but if you have an app that handles images, uris, video,, etc... you need to know these values.     right now when an intent is received via intent filter in titanium, the following lists the values/errors you will get for the data, type, and action functions and properties of an intent:     getdata() always equals null    gettype() and getaction() always throw this exception, despite the fact that logic and documentation dictates that these functions do not require arguments:  uncaught error: requires property name as first argument   the data property always returns null   the action and type properties always return undefined    proposed solution    the above listed functions and properties need to return the appropriate values for data, type, and action so that developers will know what to do with the android intent that they are receiving. like i said, if you are handling only one type of data as dictated by your intent filter, you are ok. but if you plan to handle images, video, etc... and you need to read them from ti.android.extrastream, you have no way of knowing which type of intent you are receiving.    also, i believe the implementation of getaction() and gettype() need to change so that they do not require a parameter.    test case      var win = ti.ui.createwindow();  win.addeventlistener('open', function(e)  else   });  win.open();      it will also be necessary to add an intent filter to a custom androidmanifest.xml to get this test case to receive intents. the only below needs to go in the main activity and will receive all image share intents. you can easily trigger an image share intent by long clicking on an image in the android gallery then select 'share' from the intent list. then just select your test case app from the list.      /      /      /      /  /  ",1,train

(see screenshot for the folder structure)    3. run the app with the desired avd. the starting screen image that appears is not of xhdpi but of mdpi folder.    please clarify about this issue.    note: you would also need to set the toolapilevel and some other properties as below since the xhdpi has been added to android after api level 8.        /          /8/          /              /              /          /      /      ",2,train
TIMOB-8076,Android:  V8:  GC lag can cause crash on older devices,"on older devices like droid 2, gc lag cause result in a crash when:  1) alot of object are created resulting in high memory allocation on the java side  2) said objects are available for cleanup (no reference maintained in js)  3) gc has not scanned yet due to the memory overhead on the v8 side not causing enough pressure on the gc    we need a way to notify v8 that we are running low on memory so that a gc occurs sooner than v8 would normally do on it's own.    a ticket has been linked that provides a fail case for this issue (original test case in ticket   not the one attached in the comments)",5,train

TIMOB-8342,Android: keyDispatchingTimedOut when trying to resume an app from background to foreground,"code  i personally would say majority of titanium android apps, but for this ticket, please try it with the kitchensink app.    expected behavior  when you put an app into the background, and bring it back into the foreground, it should work perfectly fine.    actual behavior  the app seems to show a black background for 12 seconds and then restarts.    steps to reproduce  i can reproduce this issue 3 out of 5 times, by doing the following:    1. if you have the kitchensink app open in memory from before, kill it. we want to make sure we start from a clean slate.  2. make sure you have your usb cable connected to your laptop and phone.  3. run the kitchensink app, wait for it to load and press the home button (don't press the back button, but instead the home button!)  4. run a few other apps in the background, i ran 'gmail', 'contacts', 'internet', 'peep', 'places', 'stocks' and 'market'. it's important that you press the home button and not the back button! (note if it doesn't work for you the first time, try opening more or even less apps, it might make a difference, depending on the device's specs).  5. once you have some apps running in the background, make sure you are back on the main home screen.  6. press the power button (lock your screen, turn the screen off, but don't power the device off!)  7. unplug the usb cable.  8. unlock your phone.  9. press on the kitchensink app icon.  10. expect to see a black background for a second or two and then it will restart the app.  11. if you don't, repeat from step 1.      notes  different apps behave differently. the kitchensink app, for example, seems to show a black background for 12 seconds and then restart the whole app. other apps, such as mister (from google play), actually shows a black screen and never continues to do anything else. the jiffy lube app, restarts and has the loading screen image visible as the background border.    kitchensink was packaged with a 2.0 ci build.    mister on google play is packaged with a 1.9.0.v20120209110134 build.    jiffy lube on google play is packaged with the 1.8.2 build.    if it doesn't work the first time, please keep trying for a while. sometimes it takes a few tries, before you can reproduce this issue. also try to restart your device, so all other apps are unloaded from memory. try to open a few more apps, or maybe even less apps, it should eventually be reproducible.    only tested on a htc sensation 4g, running android 2.3.x.",1,train
TIMOB-8368,iOS: soft keyboard behavior during orientation change is now different across handheld devices,"description:  while writing bug timob8363 we checked the behavior of this ios feature on a variety of devices and found new behavior but unique in all of them.     for the 4.0.2 device, the keyboard is not rendered correctly during rotation (see timob 8363)    on 4.3.5 when starting with the soft keyboard on screen, on orientation change, the keyboard animates offscreen then is redrawn after the ui has handled the orientation change. this occurred on both portrait to landscape and landscape to portrait orientation changes.    on ipod 5.1 the same behavior like on ipod 4.3.5, but this occurs only when making a portrait to landscape orientation change. for landscape to portrait orientation changes, the soft keyboard does not leave the screen during the orientation change, it simply rotates with the other ui elements.    steps to reproduce:  1) using sdk 2.0.0.v20120328000206 build and install ks  2) bring up the soft kb  3) rotate the device    result:  all devices show unique behavior, but in general there is a kb redraw. the older behavior was that the kb stayed on screen and rotated with the ui.    expected:  the kb stays on screen and rotates with the ui.    notes:  does not occur with 1.8.2",1,train

TIMOB-14393,Android: JS proxies are prematurely cleaned up when dalvik gc is triggered ,"originally from https:/jira.appcelerator.org/browse/timob 13664:    the problem is about javascript scope for titanium objects. in the logs, the problem was clearly after a garbage collect, so, first of all, we created a small module called ""androidgc"" which simply launch android garbage collector (not the v8 gc).  you can find this module here : https:/github.com/chronos83/timoduleandroidgc    then, we decided to use your files and made it as simple as possible. we finally got a unique app.js file with this content :      function createview());         var gc = ti.ui.createbutton();     var btn = ti.ui.createbutton();     var label = ti.ui.createlabel();          view.add(btn);     view.add(gc);          btn.addeventlistener('click', function());          var androidgc = require('ti.nartex.androidgc');     gc.addeventlistener('click', function());          return view;  }      var win = ti.ui.createwindow({});  win.open();    var view = createview();  win.add(view);      when you run this code on your android device, you should press many times on the ""gc"" button, because garbage collector may not clean your ressources each time...    if gc has be done correctly, the second button press will fail, because the label is not here anymore.  if you add the label to the view, and then change its title, no problem  if you create the label in the event listener, no problem    if you makes a reference to a global variable (without the var keyword for example), it works    if you put the function in a commonjs module, the same rules apply.    so... titanium objects created in a function (all the ti.something) may be killed by garbage collector at any time if they are not attached to a view/window, or declared as global var.    it breaks the javascript scope pattern...

TIMOB-14637,Android: Fix Titanium Build Script in order to support Genymotion Android Emulator,"genymotion is an enhanced android emulator that leverages x86 emulation with builtin haxmlike optimizations and google apis.    in order to have an simulator with a performance like the ios simulator we need to setup a x86 android emulation with intel haxm support. the problem is that by using the native avd on android sdk you can do this setup but without the google apis, namely the gmaps api, which makes testing apps depending on those apis, impossible on this high performance simulation.    although it is possible to add google apis to a standard x86 avd, the process is very complex and involves copying the libraries from other nonx86 avds and rebuilding a system image which takes a lot of time and effort for each simulator setup you want to have.    so genymotion does it all under the hood and allows us to select between several android models and even simulate external sensors and gps location, much like the apple simulator does.    the standard titanium build script has some problems that causes the simulator session not to be recognized as a valid deployment target (using titanium build p android t device), even though adb successfully recognizes the simulation under adb devices.    in order to fix this i have found some hints on a russian weblog and changed it a bit for working on my mac.    i have successfully run my titanium app on genymotion using titanium cli by doing the following:      http:/reinraus.ru/wordpress/nastraivaemtitaniumstudiodlyazapuskaprilozhenijvandroidx86/    it is written in russian, so please use the google  translate tool, he has made 3 changes on the build script.    the tutorial is for windows, so if you're running titanium on a mac or windows, just change the first patch from:      devid, devtype=output.split(""\r\n"")[1].split(""\t"")      to:      devid, devtype=output.split(""\n"")[1].split(""\t"")      it seems there is still a tiny problem with logcat on the end, but the app successfully run on genymotion after this patch.",3,train

TIMOB-15612,Android: HttpClient.abort() does not stop file upload,"currently, it's not possible to stop an upload with httpclient on android.     calling abort() does abort the transfer, but the transfer starts over from 0%, and runs to completion, somewhat hidden  even calling the onload() callback when it's done.     on the serverside, it's apparant that the socket connection is closed when abort() is called, but a new socket connection is instantly opened, where the upload is restarted.    here's some source (app.js) to reproduce the issue  it starts an upload, then abort() is called after 1 second:    var win = ti.ui.createwindow();  win.open();        var percentdone = 0;     var xhr = ti.network.createhttpclient(,       onerror : function(e) ,       onreadystatechange: function(e),       onsendstream : function(e),       timeout: 10000  });        function upload());         }            upload();  settimeout(function(),1000);        the console output looks this, where it's clear to see that somehow the transfer is reinitiated at 0%, when abort() is called:    [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  starting upload  [info][activitymanager( 1015)] displayed dk.bitfabrikken.nettest/.nettestactivity: 636ms  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  onreadystatechange: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  1% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  2% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  3% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  4% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  5% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  6% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  7% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  8% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  9% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  aborting upload  calling xhr.abort  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  0% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  1% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  2% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  3% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  4% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  5% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  6% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  7% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  8% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  9% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  10% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  11% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  12% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  13% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  14% done. readystate: 1  snip  lots of repetition  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  93% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  94% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  95% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  96% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  97% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  98% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3108)]  99% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3213)]  100% done. readystate: 1  [info][tiapi   ( 3213)]  onreadystatechange: 2  [info][tiapi   ( 3213)]  onreadystatechange: 3  [info][tiapi   ( 3213)]  onreadystatechange: 4  [info][alert   ( 3213)] (krollruntimethread) [7533,8510] onload: null        previously i've sidestepped this issue by using tcpsocket to handle uploading. however now my client wants ssl, and since that's not supported with tcpsocket, i'm back to being stuck on this error.      links to a few q&a threads where this bug is the problem:  http:/developer.appcelerator.com/question/144392/androidhttpclientabortdoesnotstopfileupload  http:/developer.appcelerator.com/question/146555/howtoabortanupload  http:/developer.appcelerator.com/question/158669/howtoabortafileuploadviahttpclientandroid  https:/developer.appcelerator.com/question/154693/httpclienthowtostopanuploadinprogressabort  https:/developer.appcelerator.com/question/152916/abortofsendingbyhttpclientshowprogressofsendreceivecharactersstream  ",5,train

TIMOB-16258,Android: ListView shifts when loaded a second time or loaded into a window without a tab,"i've trimmed down the files and code as much as i believe that i can and still maintain the layout / shifting issue. it is very simple compared to the original code.    1) create a new alloy project or start with the two tab alloy project  2) delete all the .js, .xml and .tss files  3) add the enclosed index.js, index.tss and index.xml files  4) compile and run the project on a device or an emulator  5) note that the text in the first list section is lined up with the text in the second list section. emulator64armscreensnapz002.png shows how it looks in my app. it will look different in this project because it has been trimmed down to contain static data with only two sections instead of three.  6) hit the 'r' button on the top right hand side of the first line of the list view  7) note that the name on the first line changes color from red to gray to let you know you clicked.  8) note that all the text after the second column has shifted to the left. emulator64armscreensnapz003.png shows what it looks like in my app. the output from these files do not contain any graphics of course and text has been substituted.    results:  the first 2 items on the left side of the list view don't move but the next 4 shift to the left.    expected results:  the text doesn't move.    this seems to work properly on all the ios devices and emulators that i've tried, so i believe that this is an android only issue somewhere between the titanium runtime and the android os.

lead to the crash reports above.    could it be that we have a possible race condition or something similar here, where ""proxy.getactivity()"" is called, before the proxy actually has an activity

TIMOB-16488,iOS: Property List lacks of Secure Class Protection - NSFileProtectionKey,"issue    after a revision from customer vulnerability assessment team they have raised a low priority issue in reference that the property list lacks of secure class protection   nsfileprotectionkey    the list of files they are referring to is basically everything in the installed package on the device (cache.db, cookies.binarycookies, etc.)    description    on ios, every file is encrypted with an unique encryption key as illustrated in the image. the content of a file is encrypted with a perfile key, which is wrapped with a class key (data protection class key) and stored in a file metadata, which is in turn encrypted with the file system key (emf key). the file system key is generated from the hardware uid. uid is unique per device and it is embedded in hardware and inaccessible to code running on cpu.    a file which is encrypted only with the file system key, upon physical access to the device custom ramdisk techniques can be used to steal the file from passcode protected devices. to overcome this problem data protection was introduced. data protection protects the data at rest on ios devices using encryption keys that are tied to the device passcode and uid. so if the file is protected with a data protection class and the user sets a passcode for the device, an attacker cannot access the file using custom ram disk technique until he knows the passcode. data protection provides another layer of security to files by encrypting them with a passcode generated key. file protection is enabled by setting an accessibility constant to nsfileprotectionkey file attribute. later the files are encrypted with a protection class key respective to the accessibility constant marked for that file.    ex: if a file is marked with nsprotectioncomplete accessibility constant then the file is encrypted with class 1 protection class key and it is available only when the user unlocks the device. if a file is created without specifying any accessibility constant then the file is marked as nsprotectionnone and it is accessible even the device is locked . list of accessibility constants available for files are shown in the below table.    ios reference    https:/developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/cocoa/reference/foundation/classes/nsfilemanager_class/reference/reference.html    ",13,train

TIMOB-16879,"ScrollableView: Add ""insertViewsAt()"" method","the scrollableview currently supports the "".addview()"" method to programmatically append additional views to the end of the collection. however, it has no method to insert one or more views at the beginning (prepend), or somewhere in the middle of the collection.    a http:/developer.appcelerator.com/question/161891/scrollableviewinsertaviewintoaspecificspot for this limitation involves getting the views array with .getviews(), updating the array, then reassiging the views array back to the control with .setviews(). while this works, it is not efficient and causes significant flickering on the ui with complex views, every time .setviews() is used.    it would be great to have a method like "".insertviewsat(idx, views)"" so one item (or more) can be prepended or inserted at specific locations without requiring the entire views collection to be rebound and rendered.      this would also bring the scrollableview control in line with listview and tableview, both of which feature ""insert"" methods.    in my particular case; i'm using a scrollableview to page through over 500 views which are fairly complex. loading all views into the scrollableview is not an option as that takes too much memory and crashes the app.  my solution is to have a sliding range that loads 9 views at a time (4 before and 4 after the current page) on the scrollableview.  and as the user moves left or right, it dynamically prepends or appends more views as needed, removing views also from the opposite end so only 9 views are loaded at any given time. appending with addview() works well (no need for setviews(), so no flickering), but prepending with the getviews()/update/setviews() process does not work well in these situations.

TIMOB-17446,Build scripts should accept flags indicating the path to the platform and i18n folders to use for a build,"our initial solution to aloy 858 (use alloy themes override the contents of a project's platform and i18n directories) has proven unworkable and pointed out the need to handle this at the platform level.     our attempted solution was to make a backup copy of those folders in the build directory, merge themed versions of the i18n/platform folders to the original locations, proceed with the build, then restore the originals when done. this has created problems with inconsistent states, original files being lost, etc.    the better solution for alloy would be to merge the originals and theme copies to a folder within build, then direct the platform to build using those versions. for that, we need new flags to the build scripts.    as you implement this, please consider how we might also theme the tiapp.xml, as this has also been requested. again, that should be handled at the platform level not by alloy making temp copies of files.

TIMOB-17572,iOS: ActivityIndicator does not reset when used in ListView,"a template in a listview includes an activityindicator. the first time the activity indicator appears, its spinner works fine but the second and subsequent time it appears, the spinner does not work.     steps to reproduce:    (1) create a new alloy project and drop the three attached files into their usual folders and run the project on an iphone or ios simulator.

TIMOB-17868,Windows: Investigate necessity of protect() and unprotect() usage,"protect() and unprotect() should be unnecessary for the developer to call directly, but there seem to be some cases where they appear to be required. we need to understand the reasons they are used, and upgrade the infrastructure to remove that necessity.    you need to ensure that `ti.ui.createalertdialog` api is exposed, so please copy and paste this into the `tiuimodule.cpp` js string:    ""  object.defineproperties(self.tiuialertdialog.prototype, ,get:function(),enumerable: true}""  "" });""  "" exports.createalertdialog = function(args) ;""      you also need to remove the protect/unprotect() calls inside alertdialog.    here's the test, and steps to reproduce: (code under steps)    1. click on the button  2. see the alert dialog  3. click on any of the two buttons in less than one second since shown  at this point you will see something is the console log  4. repeat set number 3 but this time wait over a second    at this point the log will not show.      var win = ti.ui.createwindow();  var btn = ti.ui.createbutton();  win.add(btn);  btn.addeventlistener('click', function () );      a.addeventlistener('click', function () );      a.show();      settimeout(function () , 1000);  });  win.open();      explanation:    since the `protect` and `unprotect` have been removed, the alert dialog proxy will die when garbage collection is called. in the button event listener we're calling gc (for testing purposes only) after one second. if you click on the button before gc, you're saved and the event listener of the alert is called. if you wait for the gc to be called, the event listener is not called.    the `share_ptr` is likely hiding a bug. in the ""click"" event handler of the alert's button (native event handler), we're checking if the proxy is still alive or not, and if it's not, we just ignore the callback to avoid a crash. but we need to realize that the native alert object and its buttons may still alive. and the question is, when will the native alert and its buttons be release from memory?    this is the reason for a `protect` and `unprotect` in the alert dialog proxy. i added the `protect` and `unprotect` back to test, and everything will go back to normal.",8,train
TIMOB-17894,iOS: Support Apple's integration of TestFlight beta testing,"as described in http:/ it currently takes a manual step to make an distappstore build compatible for distribution via apple's integration of testflight. nick also found out that the entitlement can't be left in     reading the ""submit to app store"" section in apple's https:/developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/languagesutilities/conceptual/itunesconnect_guide/chapters/betatestingtheapp.html it looks like you can leave the new entitlements in and use the same build to publish to the app store:      when you are done using testflight beta testing, you can submit the app for final review. before you submit it, make sure you no longer want to test it or any builds you uploaded earlier than it. when the app becomes ready for sale in the app store, testing automatically stops on earlier builds, and you will be unable to view or test them.      so it looks like the tooling can simply be adjusted to add the new entitlement for any dist appstore builds.",3,train

TIMOB-18401,Module using Google Maps SDK works fine when run with 3.4.1.GA crashes with 3.5.0.GA,"two years ago i developed an ios module that wrapped around google maps for ios sdk to return support for google maps on titanium projects.      https:/marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/5076?restoresearch=true#!overview      this worked fine and with every major titanium sdk release i rebuilt, tested and it always worked fine.    i used to run it using      .../3.5.0.ga/titanium.py run        but that doesn't work anymore, instead i run        python build.py        which works although it will not run in simulator which adds up to development time.    the thing is that when i tried      xcrun lipo info build/...... .a      i only got i386        so i had to recreate a new module using the new titanium cli, change the guid and add my objective c classes and google framework setup guide to it.    then after building again i managed to get it to support all architectures, so you may want to update the docs for veteran module developers.        now for the main issue:    i use the module in a 10 lines demo app which just opens a window and adds an instance of google  maps, i build it with 3.4.1.ga sdk and it runs fine in the simulator. i also used the latest 1.9.1 version of google's framework    i then simply changed the tiapp.xml to use 3.5.0.ga instead, the simulator opened, i see my debug printouts and then the app crashes, according to xcode it crashes due to a memory release that was not allocated.       malloc:  error for object 0xffcb5f0: pointer being freed was not allocated     set a breakpoint in mallocerrorbreak to debug      i tried to set the above breakpoint, i tried to see the xcode stack when it crashes but it is of no use, it crashes somewhere in the tile drawing of the google maps framework but it will not do so if run through sdk 3.4.1.ga...      fact is, that from all the components used here the only variable that changed is the titanium sdk version. so my guess is something in the list of changes of the new sdk broke something and some of the older apps won't work anymore. this module is used by many titanium developers and is bundled with their published apps.        to sum up:    1. module  sdk 3.4.1.ga  google sdk 1.9.1 = works  2. module  sdk 3.5.0.ga  google sdk 1.9.1 = crash  3. xcode project  google sdk 1.9.1  sample app = works  4. older module build compiled months ago + sdk 3.5.0.ga = crash        attached is a sample project. it has a module folder with three versions, the 1.9.3 was built with 3.5.0.ga and supports 64bit, the rest are older 32 bit only created with older sdks (3.4.0 and earlier)      you will need to get the google sdk      https:/developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios/      you will also need to tell the module where to find the google framework in the module.xcconfig file per the module docs        if you need a license key for it drop me an email : canufind1 at gmail",13,train

TIMOB-18515,iOS: TabGroup - Support UIEdgeInsets for Tab items so we can have Instagram-like tabs with only images,"the default native way to make a custom (image only) tab bar (like the one on instagram) is to use uiedgeinsets so we can reposition the image inside the tab when it has no title text.    the best way for making this happen on titanium is mapping a method and properties, allowing developers to set the tab item insets for the tab bar image (both for regular as for active images).    there is a property on uibaritem (uibarbutton item inherits from this class) called imageinsets.      tabbaritem.imageinsets = uiedgeinsetsmake(6, 0, 6, 0);      i suggest a ti method on the tab object named setimageinsets() in which developers can pass the absolute values for image insets and properly realign images inside the tabs. it would be ideal to have the imageinsets property as well so we can instance the tabs with the proper insets avoiding rendering flicks.    this is the best way to have a native tab bar without using the actual solutions of hiding the tab bar and creating a bunch of custom views on the bottom of the app or using unmaintained modules.    references:    http:/stackoverflow.com/questions/10533917/ios5customtabbarimageverticalalignment  http:/stackoverflow.com/questions/26494130/removetabbaritemtextshowonly image",3,train

TIMOB-18517,Windows: Investigate cross-platform require implementation in GlobalObject,"from https:/github.com/appcelerator/titaniummobilewindows/pull/110#discussionr24169482    it looks to me like we could implement globalobject and require entirely crossplatform, but it'd have to defer to using ti.filesystem api. right now that requires us to jump into js to do so:    jsvalue titaniumproperty = getcontext().getglobalobject().getproperty(""titanium"");  jsobject titanium = staticcast/(titaniumproperty);    jsvalue fsproperty = titanium.getproperty(""filesystem"");  jsobject fs = staticcast/(fsproperty);    jsvalue fileproperty = fs.getproperty(""file"");  jsobject file = staticcast/(fileproperty);    auto file = file.callasconstructor(path);    jsvalue resolveproperty = file.getproperty(""resolve"");  jsobject resolve = staticcast/(resolveproperty);    return resolve();      we were reluctant to do so out of concern for performance/memory overhead of accessing the js objects/properties/functions and then calling them (and marshaling the values back and forth between c types and jsvalues).    what is the actual performance overhead involved here? is it small enough that a crossplatform implementation is of high importance? is there a way we can use pure c and still do this cross platform (i.e. can we still get a reference/defer to the platform specific implementation of file when we need to)?",21,train

TIMOB-19919,Android: add ability to listen to androidback without overriding,"currently it is possible to override the default behavior for the back button. but you can't really use this for enhancing this functionality or just listen to the back button event without overriding it.    there is no way to call super.onbackpressed() from on the windows activity from javascript side.     i think it would make sense to add another property to the ti.ui.window that lets you explicitly override this behavior. i'd prefer this:    var win = ti.ui.createwindow();    win.onback = function();    win.addeventlistener('androidback', function());      does that make sense?    the reason why i need this is that i'm trying to create a proper navigation history. as there are no more lightweight windows, i want to implement a kind of backstack for views or fragments.

TIMOB-18956,Android orientation change detection is missing reverse orientation distinction,"the documentation confirms that this is missing from the various places where in android you could detect orientation change.     ti.gesture.orientationchange event http:/docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/titanium.gestureeventorientationchange      ti.gesture.orientation property http:/docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/titanium.gesturepropertyorientation      ti.android.activity. requestedorientation property http:/docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/titanium.android.activitypropertyrequestedorientation    from docs:  on android and mobile web, returns the orientation of the current window, and never reports the ""reverse"" orientations  (landscaperight and upsideportrait).    android itself does report the reverse orientation changes, titanium is just not surfacing this level of reporting.     this deficiency prevents being able to detect precisely to which orientation has the device been rotated to with respect to a view, such as a camera view needed for barcode scanning. when the device has rotated but the view (and the object which is the subject of the scanning) has not rotated, you must be able to determine what the relative rotation is without the possibility of being 180 degrees off.    let me try to illustrate how this becomes a problem with some ascii art and the scenario being a barcode scanning camera view in a module where the app must report to the module the orientation change. this is just an example of 1 use case where this deficiency can be seen as a problem.     let's say this is your device in portrait orientation:      ab        cd      abcd are the corners of the hardware, abcd are the corners of the camera view. let's say the camera sensor is mounted such that the topleft corner of the picture is nearest to the a corner, the topright corner of the picture is nearest to the b corner, etc. in this case, the rotation difference between the camera sensor and the camera view is 0 degrees, so the pixel at the topleft corner of the picture can go near the 'a' corner of the view, the pixel at the topright corner of the picture can go near the 'b' corner of the view, etc.    if the activity supports landscaperight orientation, then this is how your screen will look like if you rotate your device 90 degrees counterclockwise:      bc        ad      the important thing to realize is that the camera sensor rotated with the hardware but the view didn't, and neither did the object you are pointing the camera at. so the topleft pixel is still near the a corner as far as the camera sensor is concerned, but now that pixel needs to go to the 'c' corner of the view, otherwise from your (the user's) perspective the camera feed will look like it's rotated 90 degrees clockwise (because the object in front of the camera didn't rotate with the camera sensor).    this can be achieved by the app telling the module that the activity's ui is now in landscaperight orientation, which the module will interpret not as landscaperight per se, rather as ""rotate the camera feed 90 degrees counterclockwise"".    i think by now it should be clear why we need to distinguish between landscaperight and landscapeleft, but just for completeness  if the activity supports landscapeleft orientation as well, then this is how your screen will look like if you rotate your device 90 degrees clockwise (relative to portrait):      ca        db      the topleft pixel is still near the a corner as far as the camera sensor is concerned, but now that pixel needs to go to the 'b' corner of the view. in this case the module would have to rotate the camera feed clockwise by 90 degrees. if we can't distinguish between these two cases (i.e. landscapeleft and landscaperight), then the best we can do is to rotate the camera feed by 90 degrees in the same direction in both cases, which will mean that the camera feed will appear off by 180degrees (i.e. upsidedown) to the user in one of those cases.    similar logic applies to portrait vs. reverseportrait.    a work around would be to recreate orientation change handling in the module, however the better solution should be to improve this handling in the titanium sdk  so that the app can notify the module using titanium sdk available functions/events about this change instead of the module needing to unnecessarily replicate titanium sdk capabilities just to improve them.    this works as expected in the ios titanium sdk.",8,train

TIMOB-19000,Remove Titanium build call from Xcode pre-compile phase,"a long time ago, titanium's ios build was written in python. the ios build performed 3 major steps:    # create all xcode related files in build dir  # run xcodebuild to compile project, which in turn fires the xcode project's precompile phase script that calls the ios build again to copy the titaniumspecific resources  # xcode builds the final app and signs it    it was done this way so that you could open the generated xcode project, modify js files, and build from xcode.    when we replaced they pythonbased ios build scripts with the node.js version, there was a performance issue with xcode calling the titanium cli to copy the titanium resources. i changed things so that if you are building from the titanium cli, it would copy the xcode project related files, then the titanium related files, then finally call xcodebuild. this significantly sped things up.    the problem today is that when you run appc run, it generates a xcode project who's precompile script references the titanium cli. users do not have the titanium cli installed by default and thus it will fail. even if they did, the encryption method would vary. also the xcode project's precompile should be calling the appc run, not ti build.    i'm proposing we remove the xcode project's precompile script.    pros:   remove cruft from the ios build   there's a lot of code that accommodates the ability for titanium resources to be processed when building from xcode that we could rip out   as maintainers of the ios build changes, not all of the knowledge is transferred and thus new contributors neglect the xcode specific build path   speeds up builds when building from xcode   building from xcode only really works when you have titanium cli installed   building via appc run encrypts differently than ti build and thus building from xcode would render the new encrypted files unused and bloat the app   modifying titanium js files and building directly from xcode is not officially supported    cons:   deprecates a feature that has existed for years",8,train

TIMOB-20004,iOS: Differences between new permission request responses,"while working in the https:/github.com/appceleratordeveloperrelations/appcsampleti510 i noticed some differences between the responses of the new permission request methods. i created a separate test case to show the differences so we can address them in a next release. nothing big, except for the first bullet maybe.     unlike the others, the callback for requestlocationpermissions() is only called the first time. you have to force close and then reopen the app for it to work again.   the response for requestlocationpermissions also has authorizationstatus, which would be very useful to have in the response for the others as well.   on success, the response for requestlocationpermissions has an empty string for error where it should either have a message or be undefined.   when unknown, requestcontactspermissions has a not very helpful access denied error instead of just being undefined like calendar and camera.   unless permission was granted, the error for requestlocationpermissions is always the user is unable to allow access to location., which is not very helpful or even misleading since the user is perfectly able, he just denied permission to the app. calendar and contacts have better error messages.   when denied, the response for requestcamerapermissions has no error like the others.   i have no idea where code comes from but if i deny it (probably by coincidence) correctly maps to authorizationdenied for calendar and contacts. would be helpful to have the meaning of this code documented.   in ios 8, denying contacts permission sends success response to callback.     sample    don't forget to add /nslocationalwaysusagedescription/deny or grant permission to test different scenarios./ to tiapp.xml.      var win = ti.ui.createwindow();    var btn = ti.ui.createbutton();    btn.addeventlistener('click', function(e) ;

TIMOB-20380,iOS: Views height / width properties are not respected inside ScrollableView ,"when adding views to a scrollableview on android, the views are not rendering inside the scrollableview properly. this appears to be the result of the height and width parameters not being respected and defaulting to ti.ui.fill. as such setting the scrollableview to have a height of ti.ui.size does nothing.    the expectation is that the internal views would scale based on height and width parameters, and as such the scrollableview would have a dynamic height based on the ti.ui.size declaration. in the attached screenshots you can see how this works on ios (expected result) and on android (incorrect result)    code example:  https:/gist.github.com/grantges/ffbb0771adf091d15941",5,test

TIMOB-20483,Android HTTPClient onsendstream progress is wrong,"i've noticed that the progress callback of tihttpclient under android reaches a value of 1 way before the upload is completed. this can be seen on slow link speeds. i believe this bug also exists on normal speeds but is less apparent there.    this might be related to     i've tested this with titanium sdk 5.1.2 & 5.2.0 on android 4, 5 and 6 devices. for testing i limited my wireless link speed with ddwrt to 64kbits. this is also reproducable with slow mobile edge speeds.    the example code uses a 1 mb testfile from here:          var win = ti.ui.createwindow();   var progress = ti.ui.createprogressbar();   win.add(progress);     var timestamp = date.now();   var file = ti.filesystem.getfile('1mb.test');     win.addeventlistener('open', function() ,     onsendstream: function(e)     });    xhr.open('post', 'http:/    xhr.send()   });   win.open();        what should happen:  the link speed is constant, so the progress log should be liniear. assuming a blank response, the onload event should get called quickly after progress reached the value of 1.    what actually happens:  progress goes up to value 1 very quickly (in 1 2 seconds). it's not possible to upload 1mb in 1 second with the available bandwidth. the progress is not fired anymore after it reached the value of 1 although the upload is still in progress. after 138 seconds the onload event fires correctly. the time of the onload event is consistent with the available bandwith. router bandwith logs show also that a upload is in progress until the onload event is fired.

TIMOB-23114,Fonts issues on iOS 9,"i'm using the latest sdk but this issue has been there since the release of san francisco font. first of all, the semibold weight doesn't work, it renders a normal (regular) font (i think it would be a good idea for titanium to support more weights, this is very limited for people who care a lot about ui)  second thing, the system font on ios (san francisco) is a dynamic font, it uses custom tracking for different font sizes, this is also not working, the tracking is always 0. even when i try to embed the font and use it as a custom font, all font weights work but none of the tracking is applied which causes a not so good font display.   i don't know if this helps, but if you want to see the difference between properly rendered fonts and wrongly rendered ones, you can try using any constant of the textstyle, they render perfectly well.

TIMOB-23298,Module Error during App startup with Ti SDK 5.2.1.GA and 5.2.2.GA but works on 5.1.2.,"h6.description  we have a custom module that uses ibm's trusteer sdk to perform some device checks during app startup.     we were notified by google that our app built with sdk version 5.1.2.ga has a security vulnerability. appcelerator support recommended upgrading to 5.2.1.ga.     during upgrade, we found that the trusteer custom module failed to load during startup causing app crash. see below for the error log. we found that the issue exists in version 5.2.2.ga as well.     since it's working with 5.1.2.ga, we assume that something changed in the newer sdk versions broke the module.     h6.steps to reproduce  1. create a sample alloy or classic app.  2. paste the below code into the app.js file.  3. add the attached module.  4. run on ios device or simulator.      expected behaviour  since it works on ti sdk  5.1.2. it should works on later version.      test code    var win = ti.ui.createwindow();    / create a button.  var showdata = ti.ui.createbutton();    / listen for click events.  showdata.addeventlistener('click', function() );    / add to the parent view.  win.add(showdata);    win.open();      h6.log    [info] :   loading trusteer module...

TIMOB-23625,Windows: Progressive loading for ListView/TableView,"currently tableview and listview has performance issue where it can not load chunk of data at once because it requires a lot of cpu/memory resource. we might want to introduce ui virtualization or progressive data loading or something like that so that we can load data as many as possible.    per comments in timob23411      i'm guessing we need to do some deep looks into trying to optimize our usage of the listview implementation under the hood to avoid these issues.    i'm guessing perhaps the way the controls are nested, we're hitting a use case where the phone's ui virtualization for the listview is defeated. see https:/msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/debugtestperf/optimizegridviewandlistview     the critical portion being:  bq. the concept of a viewport is critical to ui virtualization because the framework must create the elements that are likely to be shown. in general, the viewport of an itemscontrol is the extent of the logical control. for example, the viewport of a listview is the width and height of the listview element. some panels allow child elements unlimited space, examples being scrollviewer and a grid, with autosized rows or columns. when a virtualized itemscontrol is placed in a panel like that, it takes enough room to display all of its items, which defeats virtualization. restore virtualization by setting a width and height on the itemscontrol.    lots more links out there on gridview/listview performance problems:     https:/blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/alainza/2014/09/03/listviewbasicsandvirtualizationconcepts/   https:/   http:/nanovazquez.com/2013/11/28/windows8.1gridviewandlistviewperformanceimprovements/   http:/stackoverflow.com/questions/28944705/multiplelistviewuivirtualization   http:/mikaelkoskinen.net/post/winrtxamlgridviewperformanceproblemsonwindowsrttablets      long story short? first make sure you explicitly set a size on the listview impl and not let it fill, or it'll never virtualize. second, it looks like sometimes grouping can basically kill ui virtualization as well, as each group effectively becomes autoscaled in size to contain it's items.      we also want to tackle with performance difference between tableview and listview, currently creating listview data is 5x times slower than tableview. it is likely because listview is relatively complex component with custom template support, but we'd like to close the gap as much as we can.    tableview      var win = ti.ui.createwindow();    var data = [];  var start = new date();  for (var i = 0; i < 20; i) );      sectionfruit.add(ti.ui.createtableviewrow());      sectionfruit.add(ti.ui.createtableviewrow());      data.push(sectionfruit);        var sectionveg = ti.ui.createtableviewsection();      sectionveg.add(ti.ui.createtableviewrow());      sectionveg.add(ti.ui.createtableviewrow());      data.push(sectionveg);        var sectionfish = ti.ui.createtableviewsection();      sectionfish.add(ti.ui.createtableviewrow());      sectionfish.add(ti.ui.createtableviewrow());      data.push(sectionfish);  }    var table = ti.ui.createtableview();    ti.api.info('elapsed: '  (new date()  start));    win.add(table);  win.open();      listview      var win = ti.ui.createwindow();  var listview = ti.ui.createlistview();  var sections = [];    var start = new date();  for (var i = 0; i < 20; i) );      var fruitdataset = [           },           },      ];      fruitsection.setitems(fruitdataset);      sections.push(fruitsection);        var vegsection = ti.ui.createlistsection();      var vegdataset = [           },           },      ];      vegsection.setitems(vegdataset);      sections.push(vegsection);        var fishsection = ti.ui.createlistsection();      var fishdataset = [           },           },      ];      fishsection.setitems(fishdataset);      sections.push(fishsection);  }    listview.sections = sections;    ti.api.info('elapsed: '  (new date()   start));    win.add(listview);  win.open();    ",13,test
